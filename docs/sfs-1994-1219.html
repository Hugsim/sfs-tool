      a) när någon är lagligen berövad friheten efter fällande dom av behörig domstol,<br />

Domen skall avkunnas offentligt, men pressen och allmänheten får utestängas från förhandlingen eller en del därav av hänsyn till den allmänna moralen, den allmänna ordningen eller den nationella säkerheten i ett demokratiskt samhälle, eller då minderårigas intressen eller skyddet för parternas privatliv så kräver eller, i den mån domstolen finner det strängt nödvändigt, under särskilda omständigheter när offentlighet skulle skada rättvisans intresse.<br />
   2. Var och en som blivit anklagad för brott skall betraktas som oskyldig till dess hans skuld lagligen fastställts.<br />
   3. Var och en som blivit anklagad för brott har följande minimirättigheter<br />

      d) att förhöra eller låta förhöra vittnen som åberopas mot honom samt att själv få vittnen inkallade och förhörda under samma förhållanden som vittnen åberopade mot honom,<br />
      e) att utan kostnad bistås av tolk, om han inte förstår eller talar det språk som begagnas i domstolen.<p><a name="P1S469"></a></p>

Europarådets medlemsstater, som undertecknat detta protokoll,<br />
som är fast beslutna att vidta ytterligare åtgärder för att gemensamt säkerställa vissa rättigheter och friheter genom konventionen om skydd för de mänskliga rättigheterna och de grundläggande friheterna undertecknad i Rom den 4 november 1950
(här nedan kallad "konventionen"),<br />
har kommit överens om följande.<p><a name="P1S607"></a></p>

Artikel 1 - Rättssäkerhetsgarantier vid utvisning av utlänningar<br />
   1. En utlänning som lagligen är bosatt på en stats territorium får inte utvisas därifrån utom efter ett i laga ordning fattat beslut och skall tillåtas att<br />
      a) framlägga skäl som talar mot utvisningen,<br />
      b) få sin sak omprövad och<br />
      c) för dessa ändamål företrädas genom ombud inför vederbörande myndighet eller inför en eller flera av denna myndighet utsedda personer.<br />
   2. En utlänning kan utvisas innan han utövar sina rättigheter enligt punkt 1.a, b och c i denna artikel, när utvisningen är nödvändig i den allmänna ordningens intresse eller motiveras av hänsyn till den nationella säkerheten.<p><a name="P1S608"></a></p>

Artikel 2 - Rätt till överklagande i brottmål<br />
   1. Var och en som dömts av domstol för brottslig gärning skall ha rätt att få skuldfrågan eller påföljden omprövad av högre domstol. Utövandet av denna rätt, inbegripet grunderna för dess utövande, skall regleras i lag.<br />
   2. Undantag från denna rätt får göras i fråga om mindre grova gärningar, enligt föreskrift i lag, eller i de fall då vederbörande har dömts i första instans av den högsta domstolen eller har dömts efter det att en frikännande dom har överklagats.<p><a name="P1S609"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 3 - Gottgörelse vid felaktig dom"><a name="Artikel 3 - Gottgörelse vid felaktig dom">Artikel 3 - Gottgörelse vid felaktig dom</a></h4><p><a name="P1S610"></a></p>

Har en lagakraftvunnen dom, varigenom någon dömts för brottslig gärning, senare upphävts, eller har nåd beviljats, på grund av en ny eller nyuppdagad omständighet, som styrkt att domen var felaktig, skall den som undergått straff till följd av domen gottgöras i enlighet med den berörda statens lag eller praxis, om det inte visas att det helt eller delvis berott på honom själv att den tidigare ej kända omständigheten inte blivit uppdagad i tid.<p><a name="P1S611"></a></p>

Artikel 4 - Rätt att inte bli lagförd eller straffad två gånger<br />
   1. Ingen får lagföras eller straffas på nytt i en brottmålsrättegång i samma stat för ett brott för vilket han redan blivit slutligt frikänd eller dömd i enlighet med lagen och rättegångsordningen i denna stat.<br />
   2. Bestämmelserna i föregående punkt skall inte utgöra hinder mot att målet tas upp på nytt i enlighet med lagen och rättegångsordningen i den berörda staten, om det föreligger bevis om nya eller nyuppdagade omständigheter eller om ett grovt fel har begåtts i det tidigare rättegångsförfarandet, vilket kan ha påverkat utgången i målet.<br />
   3. Avvikelse får inte ske från denna artikel med stöd av artikel 15 i konventionen.<p><a name="P1S612"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 5 - Likställdhet mellan makar"><a name="Artikel 5 - Likställdhet mellan makar">Artikel 5 - Likställdhet mellan makar</a></h4><p><a name="P1S613"></a></p>

Makar skall vara likställda i fråga om rättigheter och ansvar av privaträttslig natur inbördes samt i förhållande till sina barn, i fråga om äktenskapet, under äktenskapet och i händelse av dess upplösning. Denna artikel skall inte hindra staterna att vidta sådana åtgärder som är nödvändiga i barnens intresse.<p><a name="P1S614"></a></p>

Artikel 6 - Territoriell tillämpning<br />

En stat kan vid tidpunkten för undertecknandet eller när den deponerar sitt ratifikations-, godtagande- eller godkännandeinstrument ange på vilket territorium eller vilka territorier detta protokoll skall vara tillämpligt samt ange i vilken utsträckning den åtar sig att tillämpa protokollets bestämmelser på detta territorium eller dessa territorier.<br />
   2.

Med avseende på ett sådant territorium träder protokollet i kraft den första dagen i den månad som följer efter utgången av en period på två månader från den dag då generalsekreteraren mottog förklaringen.<br />

   6.

Strasbourg,<br />
Preambel<p><a name="P1S645"></a></p>

Europarådets medlemsstater och övriga höga fördragsslutande  parter till konventionen om skydd för de mänskliga  rättigheterna och de grundläggande friheterna, undertecknad i  Rom den 4 november 1950 (nedan kallad konventionen), som har  undertecknat detta protokoll, som beaktar bestämmelserna i  konventionen, särskilt artikel 19 om upprättande av den  europeiska domstolen för de mänskliga rättigheterna (nedan  kallad domstolen), som anser att utvidgningen av domstolens  behörighet till att ge rådgivande yttranden kommer att  förstärka samverkan mellan domstolen och de nationella  myndigheterna och därmed befästa genomförandet av konventionen  i överensstämmelse med subsidiaritetsprincipen, som beaktar  utlåtande nr 285 (2013), antaget av Europarådets  parlamentariska församling den 28 juni 2013, har kommit  överens om följande:<p><a name="P1S646"></a></p>

Artikel 1<br />
   1. De högsta domstolarna i en hög fördragsslutande part,  utsedda i enlighet med artikel 10, får begära att domstolen  lämnar rådgivande yttranden om principiella frågor som rör  tolkningen eller tillämpningen av de rättigheter och friheter  som definieras i konventionen eller dess protokoll.<br />
   2. Den begärande domstolen får endast ansöka om ett  rådgivande yttrande i samband med ett mål som är anhängigt vid  domstolen.<br />
   3. Den begärande domstolen ska motivera sin begäran  och uppge de relevanta rättsliga och faktiska omständigheterna  i det anhängiga målet.<p><a name="P1S647"></a></p>

Artikel 2<br />
   1. En panel med fem ledamöter av domstolen i stor  sammansättning bestämmer om den ska godta en begäran om  rådgivande yttrande med beaktande av artikel 1. Panelen ska  motivera varje beslut om att inte godta en begäran.<br />
   2. Om panelen godtar begäran, ska domstolen i stor  sammansättning lämna det rådgivande yttrandet.<br />
   3. Panelen och domstolen i stor sammansättning som  avses i föregående stycken innefattar automatiskt den domare  som valts för den höga fördragsslutande parten till vilken den  begärande domstolen hör. Om det inte finns någon sådan domare  eller om denne inte kan delta, ska en person utsedd av  domstolens ordförande från en lista som på förhand har ingetts  av denna part delta i egenskap av domare.<p><a name="P1S648"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 3"><a name="Artikel 3">Artikel 3</a></h4><p><a name="P1S649"></a></p>

Europarådets kommissionär för mänskliga rättigheter och den  höga fördragsslutande parten till vilken den begärande  domstolen hör har rätt att lämna skriftliga yttranden och  delta i muntliga förhandlingar. Domstolens ordförande får, för  att tillgodose intresset av en god rättskipning, inbjuda varje  annan hög fördragsslutande part eller person att också lämna  skriftliga yttranden eller delta i muntliga förhandlingar.<p><a name="P1S650"></a></p>

Artikel 4<br />
   1. Skäl ska anges för rådgivande yttranden.<br />
   2. Om det rådgivande yttrandet helt eller delvis inte  ger uttryck för ledamöternas enhälliga uppfattning, har varje  ledamot rätt att lämna sin särskilda mening.<br />
   3. Rådgivande yttranden överlämnas till den begärande  domstolen och till den höga fördragsslutande parten till  vilken domstolen hör.<br />
   4. Rådgivande yttranden ska offentliggöras.<p><a name="P1S651"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 5"><a name="Artikel 5">Artikel 5</a></h4><p><a name="P1S652"></a></p>

Mellan de höga fördragsslutande parterna ska artiklarna 1 till 
5 anses som tillägg till konventionen och samtliga  bestämmelser i konventionen ska tilllämpas i enlighet därmed.<p><a name="P1S655"></a></p>

   2. I förhållande till varje hög fördragsslutande part  som senare uttrycker sitt samtycke till att vara bunden av  protokollet träder det i kraft den första dagen i den månad  som följer efter utgången av en period av tre månader från den  dag då parten uttryckte sitt samtycke till att vara bunden av  protokollet i enlighet med bestämmelserna i artikel 7.<p><a name="P1S657"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 9"><a name="Artikel 9">Artikel 9</a></h4><p><a name="P1S658"></a></p>
