Freedom of choice<br />
   1. A contract shall be governed by the law chosen by the parties. The choice must be expressed or demonstrated with reasonable certainty by the terms of the contract or the circumstances of the case. By their choice the parties can select the law applicable to the whole or a part only of the contract.<br />
   2. The parties may at any time agree to subject the contract to a law other than that which previously governed it, whether as a result of an earlier choice under this Article or of other provisions of this Convention. Any variation by the parties of the law to be applied made after the conclusion of the contract shall not prejudice its formal validity under Article 9 or adversely affect the rights of third parties.<br />
   3. The fact that the parties have chosen a foreign law, whether or not accompanied by the choice of a foreign tribunal, shall not, where all the other elements relevant to the situation at the time of the choice are connected with one country only, prejudice the applicaiton of rules of the law of that country which cannot be derogated from by contract, hereinafter called
'mandatory rules'.<br />
   4. The existence and validity of the consent of the parties as to the choice of the applicable law shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Articles 8, 9 and 11.<p><a name="S26"></a></p><h4 name="Article 4"><a name="Article 4">Article 4</a></h4><p><a name="S27"></a></p>

Applicable law in the absence of choice<br />
   1. To the extent that the law applicable to the contract has not been chosen in accordance with Article 3, the contract shall be governed by the law of the country with which it is most closely connected. Nevertheless, a severable part of the contract which has a closer connection with another country may by way of exception be governed by the law of that other country.<br />
   2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 5 of this Article, it shall be presumed that the contract is most closely connected with the country where the party who is to effect the per-
formance which is characteristic of the contract has, at the time of conclusion of the contract, his habitual residence, or, in the case of a body corporate or unincorporate, its central administration. However, if the contract is entered into in the course of that partys trade or profession, that country shall be the country in which the principal place of business is situated or, where under the terms of the contract the performance is to be effected through a place of business other than the principal place of business, the country in which that other place of business is situated.<br />
   3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article, to the extent that the subject matter of the contract is a right in immovable property or a right to use immovable property it shall be presumed that the contract is most closely connected with the country where the immovable property is situated.<br />
   4. A contract for the carriage of goods shall not be subject to the presumption in paragraph 2. In such a contract if the country in which, at the time the contract is concluded, the carrier has his principal place of business is also the country in which the place of loading or the place of discharge or the principal place of business of the consignor is situated, it shall be presumed that the contract is most closely connected with that country. In applying this paragraph single voyage charterparties and other contracts the main purpose of which is the carriage of goods shall be treated as contracts for the carriage of goods.<br />
   5. Paragraph 2 shall not apply if the characteristic performance cannot be determined, and the presumptions in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 shall be disregarded if it appears from the circumstances as a whole that the contract is more closely connected with another country.<p><a name="S28"></a></p><h4 name="Article 5"><a name="Article 5">Article 5</a></h4><p><a name="S29"></a></p>

Certain consumer contracts<br />

for a purpose which can be regarded as being outside his trade or profession, or a contract for the provision of credit for that object.<br />
   2. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 3, a choice of law made by the parties shall not have the result of depriving the consumer of the protection afforded to him by the mandatory rules of the law of the country in which he has his habitual residence:<br />
   - if in that country the conclusion of the contract was preceded by a specific invitation addressed to him or by advertising, and he had taken in that country all the steps necessary on his part for the conclusion of the contract, or<br />
   - if the other party or his agent received the consumer's order in that country, or<br />
   - if the contract is for the sale of goods and the consumer travelled from that country to another country and there gave his order, provided that the consumers journey was arranged by the seller for the purpose of inducing the consumer to buy.<br />
   3. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 4, a contract to which this Article applies shall, in the absence of choice in accordance with Article 3, be governed by the law of the country in which the consumer has his habitual residence if it is entered into in the circumstances described in paragraph 2 of this Article.<br />
   4. This Article shall not apply to:<p><a name="S30"></a></p>

(a) a contract of carriage;<p><a name="S31"></a></p>

Individual employment contracts<br />
   1. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 3, in a contract of employment a choice of law made by the parties shall not have the result of depriving the employee of the protection afforded to him by the mandatory rules of the law which would be applicable under paragraph 2 in the absence of choice.<br />
   2. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 4, a contract of employment shall, in the absence of choice in accordance with Article 3, be governed:<p><a name="S34"></a></p>

(a) by the law of the country in which the employee habitually carries out his work in performance of the contract, even if he is temporarily employed in another country; or<p><a name="S35"></a></p>

(b) if the employee does not habitually carry out his work in any one country, by the law of the country in which the place of business through which he was engaged is situated;<p><a name="S36"></a></p>

unless it appears from the circumstances as a whole that the contract is more closely connected with another country, in which case the contract shall be governed by the law of that country.<p><a name="S37"></a></p><h4 name="Article 7"><a name="Article 7">Article 7</a></h4><p><a name="S38"></a></p>

Mandatory rules<br />
   1. When applying under this Convention the law of a country, effect may be given to the mandatory rules of the law of another country with which the situation has a close connection, if and in so far as, under the law of the latter country, those rules must be applied whatever the law applicable to the contract. In considering whether to give effect to these mandatory rules, regard shall be had to their nature and purpose and to the consequences of their application or non-application.<br />
   2. Nothing in this Convention shall restrict the application of the rules of the law of the forum in a situation where they are mandatory irrespective of the law otherwise applicable to the contract.<p><a name="S39"></a></p><h4 name="Article 8"><a name="Article 8">Article 8</a></h4><p><a name="S40"></a></p>

Material validity<br />
   1. The existence and validity of a contract, or of any term of a contract, shall be determined by the law which would govern it under this Convention if the contract or term were valid.<br />
   2. Nevertheless a party may rely upon the law of the country in which he has his habitual residence to establish that he did not consent if it appears from the circumstances that it would not be reasonable to determine the effect of his conduct in accordance with the law specified in the preceding paragraph.<p><a name="S41"></a></p><h4 name="Article 9"><a name="Article 9">Article 9</a></h4><p><a name="S42"></a></p>

   5. The provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall not apply to a contract to which Article 5 applies, concluded in the circumstances described in paragraph 2 of Article 5. The formal validity of such a contract is governed by the law of the country in which the consumer has his habitual residence.<br />
   6. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 to 4 of this Article, a contract the subject matter of which is a right in immovable property or a right to use immovable property shall be subject to the mandatory requirements of form of the law of the country where the property is situated if by that law those require-
ments are imposed irrespective of the country where the contract is concluded and irrespective of the law governing the contract.<p><a name="S43"></a></p><h4 name="Article 10"><a name="Article 10">Article 10</a></h4><p><a name="S44"></a></p>

Where a person ('the creditor') has a contractual claim upon another ('the debtor'), and a third person has a duty to satisfy the creditor, or has in fact satisfied the creditor in discharge of that duty, the law which governs the third person's duty to satisfy the creditor shall determine whether the third person is entitled to exercise against the debtor the rights which the creditor had against the debtor under the law governing their relationship and, if so, whether he may do so in full or only to a limited extent.<br />
   2. The same rule applies where several persons are subject to the same contractual claim and one of them has satisfied the creditor.<p><a name="S57"></a></p><h4 name="Article 14"><a name="Article 14">Article 14</a></h4><p><a name="S58"></a></p>

   1. Bestämmelserna i denna konvention skall tillämpas på avtalsförpliktelser i de fall då ett val skall göras mellan lagarna i olika länder.<br />

      e) frågor som omfattas av reglerna om bolag, föreningar och andra juridiska personer, såsom frågor om deras upprättande genom registrering eller på annat sätt, deras rättskapacitet, interna organisation eller upplösning samt om personligt ansvar för delägare eller medlemmar och organ i denna egenskap för bolagets, föreningens eller den juridiska personens förpliktelser,<br />

Lagval genom avtal<br />
   1. På ett avtal tillämpas den lag som parterna har valt.<br />
Lagvalet måste vara uttryckligt eller med rimlig säkerhet framgå av avtalsvillkoren eller av övriga omständigheter. Genom sitt val kan parterna ange tillämplig lag för hela avtalet eller för endast en del av det.<br />
   2. Parterna kan när som helst komma överens om att en annan lag skall vara tillämplig på avtalet än den lag som tidigare gällde för det antingen till följd av ett tidigare val enligt denna artikel eller till följd av andra bestämmelser i denna konvention. En ändring i valet av tillämplig lag som görs av parterna efter avtalsslutet påverkar inte avtalets giltighet till formen enligt artikel 9. Det försämrar inte heller tredje mans rättigheter.<br />
   3. Den omständigheten att parterna har valt en utländsk lag skall, oavsett om de också har avtalat om behörighet för en utländsk domstol eller inte, när alla andra omständigheter av betydelse vid tidpunkten för valet har anknytning till ett enda land, inte hindra tillämpningen av sådana regler i det landet som inte kan avtalas bort, härefter benämnda "tvingande regler".<br />
   4. Frågor om förekomsten och giltigheten av parternas samtycke till att en viss lag skall vara tillämplig avgörs enligt bestämmelserna i artiklarna 8, 9 och 11.<p><a name="S10"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 4"><a name="Artikel 4">Artikel 4</a></h4><p><a name="S11"></a></p>

Tillämplig lag i avsaknad av parternas lagval<br />
   1. I den utsträckning tillämplig lag för avtalet inte har valts i enlighet med artikel 3 skall avtalet vara underkastat lagen i det land som det har närmast anknytning till. Om en del av avtalet kan skiljas från resten av avtalet och denna del har närmare anknytning till ett annat land, kan dock lagen i det landet undantagsvis tillämpas på denna del.<br />
   2. Med förbehåll för vad som föreskrivs i punkt 5 skall det antas att avtalet har närmast anknytning till det land där den part som skall utföra den prestation som är karaktäristisk för avtalet har sin vanliga vistelseort vid avtalsslutet eller, om det gäller ett bolag, en förening eller en annan juridisk person, sin centrala förvaltning. Om avtalet ingås som ett led i denna parts affärsverksamhet eller yrkesverksamhet, skall detta land dock vara det land där det huvudsakliga verksamhetsstället är beläget eller, om enligt avtalet prestationen skall fullgöras från ett annat verksamhetsställe, det land där det andra verksamhetsstället är beläget.<br />
   3. Oavsett bestämmelserna i punkt 2 skall det, i den mån avtalet gäller en sakrätt i fast egendom eller en nyttjanderätt till fast egendom, antas att avtalet har närmast anknytning till det land där den fasta egendomen är belägen.<br />
   4. För avtal om godstransport gäller inte antagandet i punkt 2.<br />
Sådana avtal skall antas ha närmast anknytning till det land där transportören vid den tidpunkt då avtalet ingicks hade sitt huvudsakliga verksamhetsställe, om det landet också är det land där platsen för lastning eller lossning finns eller där avsändaren har sitt huvudsakliga verksamhetsställe. Vid tillämpning av denna punkt skall certepartier för en enstaka resa och andra avtal vilkas huvudsyfte är transport av gods anses som avtal om godstransport.<br />
   5. Punkt 2 skall inte tillämpas om det inte kan avgöras vilken den karaktäristiska prestationen är. Antagandena i punkterna 2-4 skall inte gälla, om det framgår av de samlade omständigheterna att avtalet har närmare anknytning till ett annat land.<p><a name="S12"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 5"><a name="Artikel 5">Artikel 5</a></h4><p><a name="S13"></a></p>

Konsumentavtal<br />
   1. Denna artikel är tillämplig på avtal om leverans av varor eller utförande av tjänster åt en person (konsumenten) för ändamål som kan anses ligga utanför hans affärsverksamhet eller yrkesverksamhet och på avtal om kredit för sådana prestationer.<br />
   2. Oavsett bestämmelserna i artikel 3 skall parternas val av tillämplig lag inte medföra att konsumenten berövas det skydd som tillförsäkras honom enligt tvingande regler i lagen i det land där han har sin vanliga vistelseort,<br />
   - om avtalet föregicks av ett särskilt anbud riktat till konsumenten i det landet eller av annonsering där och konsumenten där vidtog de för avtalets ingående nödvändiga åtgärderna, eller<br />
   - om den andra parten eller dennes representant mottog konsumentens beställning i det landet, eller<br />
   - om avtalet avser försäljning av varor och konsumenten reste från det landet till ett annat land och gjorde sin beställning där, förutsatt att konsumentens resa arrangerades av säljaren i syfte att förmå konsumenten att köpa.<br />
   3. Oavsett bestämmelserna i artikel 4 skall avtal som den här artikeln är tillämplig på, i avsaknad av lagval enligt artikel 3, vara underkastade lagen i det land där konsumenten har sin vanliga vistelseort, om de ingås under de omständigheter som anges i punkt 2.<br />
   4. Denna artikel skall inte tillämpas på<br />
      a) transportavtal,<br />
      b) avtal om utförande av tjänster, om tjänsterna skall utföras uteslutande i ett annat land än det där konsumenten har sin vanliga vistelseort.<br />
   5. Oavsett bestämmelserna i punkt 4 tillämpas denna artikel på avtal om en kombination av resa och inkvartering för ett gemensamt pris.<p><a name="S14"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 6"><a name="Artikel 6">Artikel 6</a></h4><p><a name="S15"></a></p>

Individuella anställningsavtal<br />
   1. Oavsett bestämmelserna i artikel 3 skall parternas val av tillämplig lag i ett anställningsavtal inte medföra att den anställde berövas det skydd som tillförsäkras honom enligt tvingande regler i den lag som enligt punkt 2 skulle tillämpas om inget lagval gjorts.<br />
   2. Oavsett bestämmelserna i artikel 4 skall ett anställnings-
avtal i avsaknad av lagval enligt artikel 3 vara underkastat<br />
      a) lagen i det land där den anställde vid fullgörande av avtalet vanligtvis utför sitt arbete, även om han tillfälligt är sysselsatt i ett annat land, eller<br />
      b) om den anställde inte vanligtvis<p><a name="S16"></a></p>

utför sitt arbete i ett och samma land, lagen i det land där det verksamhetsställe genom vilket han anställdes är beläget,<br />
om det inte av de samlade omständigheterna framgår att avtalet har närmare anknytning till ett annat land, i vilket fall avtalet skall vara underkastat lagen i det landet.<p><a name="S17"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 7"><a name="Artikel 7">Artikel 7</a></h4><p><a name="S18"></a></p>

Internationellt tvingande regler<br />
   1. När lagen i ett visst land tillämpas enligt denna konvention kan tvingande bestämmelser i lagen i ett annat land till vilket situationen har nära anknytning tillerkännas verkan, om och i den utsträckning som enligt lagen i det senare landet dessa regler skall tillämpas oavsett vilken lag som är tillämplig på avtalet. Vid bedömningen av om sådana tvingande regler skall tillerkännas verkan skall hänsyn tas till deras art och syfte liksom till följderna av att de tillämpas eller inte tillämpas.<br />
   2. Denna konvention skall inte begränsa tillämpningen av regler i domstolslandets lag när de är tvingande oavsett vilken lag som i övrigt skall tillämpas på avtalet.<p><a name="S19"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 8"><a name="Artikel 8">Artikel 8</a></h4><p><a name="S20"></a></p>

Materiell giltighet<br />
   1. Förekomsten och giltigheten av ett avtal eller en bestämmelse i ett avtal skall avgöras enligt den lag som skulle tillämpas enligt denna konvention, om avtalet eller bestämmelsen var giltig.<br />
   2. En part kan dock åberopa lagen i det land där han har sin vanliga vistelseort för att få fastställt att han inte har samtyckt till avtalet eller avtalsbestämmelsen, om det framgår av omständigheterna att det inte skulle vara rimligt att avgöra verkan av hans uppträdande enligt den lag som anges i föregående punkt.<p><a name="S21"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 9"><a name="Artikel 9">Artikel 9</a></h4><p><a name="S22"></a></p>

Giltighet till formen<br />
   1. Ett avtal som ingås mellan personer som befinner sig i samma land är giltigt till formen, om det uppfyller formkraven i den lag<p><a name="S23"></a></p>

som gäller för avtalet enligt denna konvention eller i lagen i det land där avtalet ingås.<br />
   2. Ett avtal som ingås mellan personer som befinner sig i olika länder är giltigt till formen, om det uppfyller formkraven i den lag<p><a name="S24"></a></p>

som gäller för avtalet enligt denna konvention eller i lagen i något av dessa länder.<br />
   3. När ett avtal ingås av en representant är det land där representanten handlar det relevanta landet vid tillämpningen av punkterna 1<p><a name="S25"></a></p>

och 2.<br />
   4. En ensidig rättshandling som avser ett existerande eller ett framtida avtal är giltig till formen, om den uppfyller formkraven i den lag som enligt denna konvention gäller för eller skulle gälla för avtalet eller i lagen i det land där rättshandlingen företogs.<br />
   5. Bestämmelserna i de föregående punkterna skall inte tillämpas<p><a name="S26"></a></p>

på avtal som omfattas av artikel 5 och som har ingåtts under de omständigheter som anges i artikel 5.2. Giltigheten till formen av sådana avtal avgörs enligt lagen i det land där konsumenten har sin vanliga vistelseort.<br />
   6. Oavsett punkterna 1-4 i denna artikel skall ett avtal som avser sakrätt i fast egendom eller nyttjanderätt till fast egendom vara underkastat sådana tvingande formkrav som ställs enligt lagen i det land där egendomen är belägen, om sådana krav ställs enligt den lagen oavsett i vilket land avtalet har ingåtts och oavsett vilken lag som gäller för avtalet.<p><a name="S27"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 10"><a name="Artikel 10">Artikel 10</a></h4><p><a name="S28"></a></p>

Den tillämpliga lagens räckvidd<br />
   1. Den lag som är tillämplig på avtalet enligt artiklarna 3-6 och 12 i denna konvention skall reglera särskilt<br />
      a) avtalets tolkning,<br />
      b) dess fullgörelse,<br />
      c) följderna vid avtalsbrott, däribland uppskattning av skada i den mån sådan uppskattning regleras av rättsregler, dock endast inom ramen för de befogenheter som tillkommer domstolen enligt dess processuella regler,<br />
      d) olika sätt att få förpliktelserna att upphöra, samt preskription och andra rättighetsförluster som följer av utgången av en frist,<br />
      e) följderna av avtalets ogiltighet.<br />
   2. När det gäller sättet för fullgörelse och åtgärder med anledning av bristande fullgörelse skall hänsyn tas till lagen i det land där fullgörelsen äger rum.<p><a name="S29"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 11"><a name="Artikel 11">Artikel 11</a></h4><p><a name="S30"></a></p><h4 name="Bristande rättskapacitet och bristande rättslig handlingsförmåga"><a name="Bristande rättskapacitet och bristande rättslig handlingsförmåga">Bristande rättskapacitet och bristande rättslig handlingsförmåga</a></h4><p><a name="S31"></a></p>

När ett avtal har ingåtts mellan personer som befinner sig i samma land, kan en fysisk person som har rättskapacitet och rättshandlingsförmåga enligt lagen i det landet åberopa bristande rättskapacitet och bristande rättshandlingsförmåga enligt en annan lag, endast om den andra avtalsparten när avtalet ingicks kände till eller borde ha känt till denna brist.<p><a name="S32"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 12"><a name="Artikel 12">Artikel 12</a></h4><p><a name="S33"></a></p>

Överlåtelse av fordran<br />
   1. Överlåtarens och förvärvarens inbördes förpliktelser vid överlåtelse av en fordran skall bestämmas enligt den lag som enligt denna konvention är tillämplig på avtalet mellan överlåtaren och förvärvaren.<br />
   2. Den lag som är tillämplig på den överlåtna fordringen skall reglera dess överlåtbarhet, förhållandet mellan förvärvaren och gäldenären, de förutsättningar under vilka överlåtelsen kan göras gällande mot gäldenären och frågan om en prestation av gäldenären befriar honom från hans förpliktelser.<p><a name="S34"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 13"><a name="Artikel 13">Artikel 13</a></h4><p><a name="S35"></a></p>

Subrogation<br />
   1. När en person (borgenären) har en avtalsgrundad fordran mot en annan person (gäldenären) och en tredje person är skyldig att prestera till borgenären eller redan har presterat till denne till uppfyllelse av sin skyldighet, skall frågan om den tredje personen har rätt att mot gäldenären helt eller delvis utöva de rättigheter som borgenären hade mot gäldenären enligt den lag som gäller för förhållandet dem emellan avgöras enligt den lag som gäller för den tredje personens skyldighet att prestera till borgenären.<br />
   2. Samma regel gäller när flera personer har samma avtalsförpliktelse och en av dem har fullgjort prestationen till borgenären.<p><a name="S36"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 14"><a name="Artikel 14">Artikel 14</a></h4><p><a name="S37"></a></p>

Bevisbördan m.m.<br />
   1. Den lag som enligt denna konvention gäller för ett avtal skall tillämpas även i den mån den för avtalsrättsliga förhållanden uppställer rättsliga presumtioner eller fördelar bevisbördan.<br />
   2. Bevisning om ett avtal eller en rättshandling får föras med varje slags bevismedel som godtas enligt lagen i domstolslandet eller enligt någon av de i artikel 9 angivna lagarna enligt vilka avtalet eller rättshandlingen har giltighet till formen, förutsatt att sådan bevisföring kan genomföras vid domstolen.<p><a name="S38"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 15"><a name="Artikel 15">Artikel 15</a></h4><p><a name="S39"></a></p><h4 name="Renvoi är utesluten"><a name="Renvoi är utesluten">Renvoi är utesluten</a></h4><p><a name="S40"></a></p>

När konventionen föreskriver att lagen i ett visst land skall tillämpas avses gällande rättsregler i det landet, med undantag för landets internationellt privaträttsliga regler.<p><a name="S41"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 16"><a name="Artikel 16">Artikel 16</a></h4><p><a name="S42"></a></p><h4 name="Ordre public"><a name="Ordre public">Ordre public</a></h4><p><a name="S43"></a></p>

      I. Angelägna om att så långt det är möjligt undvika spridning av lagvalsregler mellan flera olika instrument och skillnader mellan dessa regler, uttrycker de sin önskan om att Europeiska gemenskapernas institutioner vid utövandet av sina befogenheter enligt de fördrag genom vilka de upprättades, vid behov kommer att sträva efter att anta lagvalsregler som så långt det är möjligt är förenliga med reglerna i denna konvention.<p><a name="S85"></a></p>

II. De förklarar att de från dagen för undertecknandet av denna konvention tills de blir bundna av artikel 24 har för avsikt att samråda inbördes, om någon av signatärstaterna önskar tillträda någon konvention som förfarandet enligt<p><a name="S86"></a></p>

Bestämmelserna i denna punkt gäller endast avgöranden som har vunnit laga kraft.<br />
   2. Den tolkning som görs av domstolen i anledning av en sådan begäran påverkar inte de avgöranden som gav upphov till begäran om tolkning.<br />
