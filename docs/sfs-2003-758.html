and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.<br />
   2.

In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.<p><a name="P3S45"></a></p><h4 name="Article 10"><a name="Article 10">Article 10</a></h4><p><a name="P3S46"></a></p>

The competent authorities of the Contracting States may by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this limitation.<p><a name="P3S49"></a></p>

   5. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.<br />
   6. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.<br />
   7. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-
claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.<p><a name="P3S57"></a></p><h4 name="Article 12"><a name="Article 12">Article 12</a></h4><p><a name="P3S58"></a></p>

Royalties<br />
   1. Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.<br />
   2. However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other Contracting State the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this limitation.<br />
   3.

In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.<br />
   5. Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the obligation to pay these royalties was incurred, and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.<br />
   6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-
mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.<p><a name="P3S60"></a></p><h4 name="Article 13"><a name="Article 13">Article 13</a></h4><p><a name="P3S61"></a></p>

      a) Where a resident of Portugal derives income which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention may be taxed in Sweden, Portugal shall allow as a deduction from the tax on the income of that resident an amount equal to the income tax paid in Sweden.

      b) Where in accordance with any provision of the Convention income derived by a resident of Portugal is exempt from tax in this State Portugal may nevertheless, in calculating the amount of tax on the remaining income of such resident, take into account the exempted income.<br />
   2. In the case of Sweden, double taxation shall be avoided as follows:<br />
      a) Where a resident of Sweden derives income which under the laws of Portugal and in accordance with the provisions of this Convention may be taxed in Portugal, Sweden shall allow -

Non-discrimination<br />

This provision shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 1, also apply to persons who are not residents of one or both of the Contracting States.<br />
   2. The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities.

   3. Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9, paragraph 7 of Article 11, or paragraph 6 of Article 12, apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State.

Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State are or may be subjected.<br />

Mutual agreement procedure<br />
   1. Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, he may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present his case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which he is a resident or, if his case comes under paragraph 1 of Article 23, to that of the Contracting State of which he is a national. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.<br />
   2. The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting State.<br />
   3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention.

(including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes covered by the Convention. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions.<br />
   2. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 1 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:<br />
      a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;<br />
      b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;<br />

At the request of the applicant State, the requested State shall, with a view to the recovery of an amount of tax, take measures of conservancy even if the claim is contested or is not yet the subject of an instrument permitting enforcement, insofar as such is permitted by the laws and administrative practice of the requested State.<br />
   3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall consult each other to decide the mode of application of this Article in case they consider the rendering of assistance in recovery of taxes feasible.<p><a name="P3S97"></a></p><h4 name="Article 27"><a name="Article 27">Article 27</a></h4><p><a name="P3S98"></a></p><h4 name="Limitations of benefits"><a name="Limitations of benefits">Limitations of benefits</a></h4><p><a name="P3S99"></a></p>

   2. I fall då en avtalsslutande stat i inkomsten för ett företag i denna stat inräknar - och i överensstämmelse därmed beskattar
- inkomst, för vilken ett företag i den andra avtalsslutande staten beskattats i denna andra stat, samt den sålunda inräknade inkomsten är sådan som skulle ha tillkommit företaget i den förstnämnda staten om de villkor som avtalats mellan företagen hade varit sådana som skulle ha avtalats mellan av varandra oberoende företag, skall denna andra stat genomföra vederbörlig justering av det skattebelopp som påförts för inkomsten där om denna andra stat finner justeringen berättigad. Vid sådan justering iakttas övriga bestämmelser i detta avtal och de behöriga myndigheterna i de avtalsslutande staterna överlägger vid behov med varandra.<p><a name="P3S180"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 10"><a name="Artikel 10">Artikel 10</a></h4><p><a name="P3S181"></a></p>

De behöriga myndigheterna i de avtalsslutande staterna kan träffa överenskommelse om sättet att genomföra dessa begränsningar.<p><a name="P3S184"></a></p>

I sådant fall tillämpas bestämmelserna i artikel 7 respektive artikel 14.<br />
   5. Om bolag med hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat förvärvar inkomst från den andra avtalsslutande staten, får denna andra stat inte beskatta utdelning som bolaget betalar, utom i den mån utdelningen betalas till person med hemvist i denna andra stat eller i den mån den andel på grund av vilken utdelningen betalas äger verkligt samband med fast driftställe eller stadigvarande anordning i denna andra stat, och ej heller på bolagets icke utdelade vinst ta ut en skatt som utgår på bolagets icke utdelade vinst, även om utdelningen eller den icke utdelade vinsten helt eller delvis utgörs av inkomst som uppkommit i denna andra stat.<p><a name="P3S186"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 11"><a name="Artikel 11">Artikel 11</a></h4><p><a name="P3S187"></a></p>

Dessa personer eller myndigheter skall använda upplysningarna endast för sådana ändamål. De får yppa upplysningarna vid offentlig rättegång eller i domstolsavgöranden.<br />
   2. Bestämmelserna i punkt 1 anses inte medföra skyldighet för en avtalsslutande stat att<br />
