In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.<br />
   5. Where a company which is a resident of a territory derives profits or income from the other territory, that other territory may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other territory or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other territory, nor subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on the company's undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other territory.<p><a name="P5S61"></a></p><h4 name="Article 11"><a name="Article 11">Article 11</a></h4><p><a name="P5S62"></a></p>

However, such interest may also be taxed in the territory in which it arises and according to the laws of that territory, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other territory, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest. The competent authorities of the territories may by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this limitation.<br />
   3.

(d) the interest is paid between banks.<br />
   5. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a territory, carries on business in the other territory in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other territory independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.<br />
   6. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a territory when the payer is a resident of that territory. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of a territory or not, has in a territory a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the territory in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.<br />
   7. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-
claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each territory, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement.<p><a name="P5S69"></a></p><h4 name="Article 12"><a name="Article 12">Article 12</a></h4><p><a name="P5S70"></a></p>

However, such royalties may also be taxed in the territory in which they arise and according to the laws of that territory, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other territory, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties. The competent authorities of the territories may by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this limitation.<br />
   3. The term "royalties" as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work including cinematograph films and films or tapes for radio or television broadcasting, any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience.<br />
   4.

Med beaktande av bestämmelserna i lagstiftningen i ett territorium, även i den lydelse de i framtiden kan få, beträffande avräkning från skatt som påförs i detta territorium, av skatt som erlagts utanför territoriet (vilket inte påverkar den allmänna principen i denna artikel), skall skatt som erlagts enligt lagstiftningen i det andra territoriet och i överensstämmelse med detta avtal, antingen direkt eller genom skatteavdrag, i fråga om inkomst som förvärvats av en person med hemvist i det förstnämnda territoriet, från källor i det andra territoriet, avräknas från skatt som påförs i det förstnämnda territoriet i fråga om den inkomsten.<br />
Avräkningsbeloppet skall emellertid inte överstiga den skatt i det förstnämnda territoriet som belöper på inkomsten i fråga, beräknad i enlighet med dess skattelagstiftning och föreskrifter.<p><a name="P5S185"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 23"><a name="Artikel 23">Artikel 23</a></h4><p><a name="P5S186"></a></p>

Förbud mot diskriminering<br />
   1. Medborgare i ett territorium skall inte i det andra territoriet bli föremål för beskattning eller därmed sammanhängande krav som är av annat slag eller mer tyngande än den beskattning och därmed sammanhängande krav som medborgare i detta andra territorium under samma förhållanden, särskilt såvitt avser hemvist, är eller kan bli underkastad.<br />
   2. Beskattningen av fast driftställe, som företag i ett territorium har i det andra territoriet, skall i detta andra territorium inte vara mindre fördelaktig än beskattningen av företag i detta andra territorium, som bedriver verksamhet av samma slag. Denna bestämmelse anses inte medföra skyldighet för ett territorium att medge person med hemvist i det andra territoriet sådant personligt avdrag vid beskattningen, sådan skattebefrielse eller skattenedsättning på grund av civilstånd eller försörjningsplikt mot familj som medges person med hemvist i det egna territoriet.<br />
   3. Utom i de fall då bestämmelserna i artikel 9 punkt 1, artikel 11 punkt 7 eller artikel 12 punkt 6 tillämpas, är ränta, royalty och annan betalning från företag i ett territorium till person med hemvist i det andra territoriet avdragsgilla vid bestämmandet av den beskattningsbara inkomsten för sådant företag på samma villkor som betalning till person med hemvist i det förstnämnda territoriet.<br />
   4. Företag i ett territorium, vars kapital helt eller delvis ägs eller kontrolleras, direkt eller indirekt, av en eller flera personer med hemvist i det andra territoriet, skall inte i det förstnämnda territoriet bli föremål för beskattning eller därmed sammanhängande krav som är av annat slag eller mer tyngande än den beskattning och därmed sammanhängande krav som annat liknande företag i det förstnämnda territoriet är eller kan bli underkastat.<br />
   5. Utan hinder av bestämmelserna i artikel 2 tillämpas bestämmelserna i denna artikel på skatter av varje slag och beskaffenhet.<p><a name="P5S187"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 24"><a name="Artikel 24">Artikel 24</a></h4><p><a name="P5S188"></a></p>

Förfarandet vid ömsesidig överenskommelse<br />
   1. Om en person anser att ett territorium eller båda territorierna vidtagit åtgärder som för honom medför eller kommer att medföra beskattning som strider mot bestämmelserna i detta avtal, kan han, utan att detta påverkar hans rätt att använda sig av de rättsmedel som finns i dessa territoriers interna rättsordningar, lägga fram saken för den behöriga myndigheten i det territorium där han har hemvist. Saken skall läggas fram inom tre år från den tidpunkt då personen i fråga fick vetskap om den åtgärd som givit upphov till beskattning som strider mot bestämmelserna i avtalet.<br />
   2. Om den behöriga myndigheten finner invändningen grundad men inte själv kan få till stånd en tillfredsställande lösning, skall myndigheten söka lösa frågan genom ömsesidig överenskommelse med den behöriga myndigheten i det andra territoriet i syfte att undvika beskattning som strider mot avtalet. Överenskommelse som träffats skall genomföras utan hinder av tidsgränser i territoriernas interna lagstiftning.<br />
   3. De behöriga myndigheterna i territorierna skall genom ömsesidig överenskommelse söka avgöra svårigheter eller tvivelsmål som uppkommer i fråga om tolkningen eller tilllämpningen av avtalet. De kan även överlägga i syfte att undanröja dubbelbeskattning i fall som inte omfattas av avtalet.<br />
   4. De behöriga myndigheterna i territorierna kan träda i direkt förbindelse med varandra i syfte att träffa överenskommelse i de fall som angivits i föregående punkter.<p><a name="P5S189"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 25"><a name="Artikel 25">Artikel 25</a></h4><p><a name="P5S190"></a></p>

Utbyte av upplysningar<br />
   1. De behöriga myndigheterna i territorierna skall utbyta sådana upplysningar som är nödvändiga för att tillämpa bestämmelserna i detta avtal eller i territoriernas interna lagstiftning beträffande skatter som omfattas av avtalet, om beskattningen enligt denna lagstiftning inte strider mot avtalet. Utbytet av upplysningar begränsas inte av artikel 1.<br />
Upplysningar som behörig myndighet i ett territorium tagit emot skall behandlas som hemliga på samma sätt som upplysningar som inhämtats enligt den interna lagstiftningen i detta territorium och får yppas endast för personer eller myndigheter (däri inbegripet domstolar och förvaltningsorgan) som fastställer, uppbär eller driver in de skatter som omfattas av avtalet eller handlägger åtal eller överklagande i fråga om dessa skatter.<br />
Dessa personer eller myndigheter får använda upplysningarna endast för sådana ändamål. De får yppa upplysningarna vid offentliga rättegångar eller i domstolsavgöranden.<br />
   2. Bestämmelserna i punkt 1 anses inte medföra skyldighet för ett territorium att:<br />
      a) vidta förvaltningsåtgärder som avviker från lagstiftning och administrativ praxis i detta territorium eller i det andra territoriet,<br />
      b) lämna upplysningar som inte är tillgängliga enligt lagstiftning eller sedvanlig administrativ praxis i detta territorium eller i det andra territoriet,<br />
      c) lämna upplysningar som skulle röja affärshemlighet, industri-, handels- eller yrkeshemlighet eller i näringsverksamhet nyttjat förfaringssätt eller upplysningar, vilkas överlämnande skulle strida mot allmänna hänsyn.<p><a name="P5S191"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 26"><a name="Artikel 26">Artikel 26</a></h4><p><a name="P5S192"></a></p><h4 name="Begränsning av förmåner"><a name="Begränsning av förmåner">Begränsning av förmåner</a></h4><p><a name="P5S193"></a></p>

Utan hinder av övriga bestämmelser i detta avtal, om<br />
      a) bolag med hemvist i ett territorium förvärvar sina inkomster huvudsakligen utanför detta territorium<p><a name="P5S194"></a></p><pre>1)      från aktiviteter sådana som bank-, sjöfarts-, finans- eller
</pre>
försäkringsverksamhet, eller<p><a name="P5S195"></a></p><pre>2)      genom att vara huvudkontor, co-ordination centre eller
</pre>
liknande enhet som tillhandahåller administrativa eller andra tjänster till en grupp av bolag som bedriver rörelse huvudsakligen utanför det förstnämnda territoriet, och<br />
      b) sådan inkomst, i andra fall än då tillämpning sker av den metod för att undvika dubbelbeskattning som normalt tillämpas av detta territorium, beskattas väsentligt lägre enligt det territoriets lagstiftning än inkomst av liknande verksamhet som bedrivs inom detta territorium eller inkomst från verksamhet som huvudkontor, co-ordination centre eller liknande enhet som tillhandahåller administrativa eller andra tjänster till en grupp av bolag som bedriver rörelse inom detta territorium,<br />
skall de bestämmelser i detta avtal som medger undantag från beskattning eller reduktion av skatt inte tillämpas på inkomst som sådant bolag förvärvar och inte heller på utdelning som betalas av sådant bolag.<p><a name="P5S196"></a></p><h4 name="Bilaga"><a name="Bilaga">Bilaga</a></h4><p><a name="P5S197"></a></p>

Avgifter för visum, pass och legalisering (av dokument) samt ränta som tas emot av Taipeis delegation i Sverige och Sveriges Exportråd i Taipei eller deras efterträdare som bedriver verksamhet som främjar handels-, investerings- och kulturutbyte mellan territorierna, skall beskattas endast i det territorium för vilkets räkning verksamheten bedrivs.<p><a name="P5S198"></a></p><h4 name="I fråga om artikel 10"><a name="I fråga om artikel 10">I fråga om artikel 10</a></h4><p><a name="P5S199"></a></p>

Om det territorium som avses i artikel 2 punkt 1 b) i förhållande till ett tredje territorium, som är medlem av Europeiska unionen, undantar utdelning från beskattning eller reducerar skattesatsen på utdelning till lägre än 10 procent, skall sådant undantag eller sådan reduktion automatiskt tillämpas som om det hade föreskrivits i detta avtal. Denna bestämmelse skall dock endast tillämpas på utdelning där den som har rätt till utdelningen är ett bolag (annat än handelsbolag) som innehar minst 10 procent av det utbetalande bolagets sammanlagda röstvärde.<p><a name="P5S200"></a></p><h4 name="I fråga om artikel 11"><a name="I fråga om artikel 11">I fråga om artikel 11</a></h4><p><a name="P5S201"></a></p>
