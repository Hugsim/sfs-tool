   1.

   2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Article, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.<br />
   3. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are shown to have been incurred for the purposes of the business of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.<br />

   4. No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise. Provided that where that permanent establishment is also used as a sales outlet for the goods or merchandise so purchased the profits on such sales may be attributed to that permanent establishment. For the purpose of this paragraph sales outlet shall be deemed to have the same meaning as in paragraph 4 of Article 5.<br />
   5. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.<br />
   6. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Agreement, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.<p><a name="P4S73"></a></p><h4 name="Article 8"><a name="Article 8">Article 8</a></h4><p><a name="P4S74"></a></p>

(b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,<br />
and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.<br />
   2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State - and taxes accordingly - profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.<p><a name="P4S79"></a></p><h4 name="Article 10"><a name="Article 10">Article 10</a></h4><p><a name="P4S80"></a></p>

Dividends<br />
   1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.<br />

(a) 7.5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) which holds directly at least 10 per cent of the capital of the company paying the dividends;<p><a name="P4S82"></a></p>

(b) 10 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.<p><a name="P4S83"></a></p>

The competent authorities of the Contracting States may by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of these limitations.<p><a name="P4S84"></a></p>

This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.<br />
   3. The term "dividends" as used in this Article means income from shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income from other corporate rights which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.<br />
   4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.<br />
   5. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that other State, nor subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on the company's undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.<br />
   6. The provisions of this Article shall not apply if the right giving rise to the dividend was created or assigned mainly for the purpose of taking advantage of this Article and not for bona-fide commercial reasons.<p><a name="P4S85"></a></p><h4 name="Article 11"><a name="Article 11">Article 11</a></h4><p><a name="P4S86"></a></p>

Interest<br />
   1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.<br />
   2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises, and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 7.5 per cent of the gross amount of the interest. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this limitation.<br />
   3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article, interest mentioned in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be taxable only in the Contracting State where the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident if one of the following requirements is fulfilled:<p><a name="P4S87"></a></p>

It is agreed that if in any agreement or convention between Nigeria and a member state of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) signed after the signing of this Agreement the word "delivery" is included in a provision or provisions corresponding to sub-paragraph (a) or sub-
paragraph (b) of paragraph 3 of Article 5, or both sub-
paragraphs, sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph 3 of Article 5 of this Agreement shall automatically be applied as if the word "delivery" had been so included from the same time when the agreement or convention between Nigeria and the third state becomes effective.<p><a name="P4S173"></a></p><h4 name="Article 7"><a name="Article 7">Article 7</a></h4><p><a name="P4S174"></a></p>

It is agreed that the provisions of sub-paragraphs (b) and (c)
of paragraph 1 of Article 7 shall apply only where sales and business activities are effected directly by the enterprise in the other Contracting State through other outlets than the permanent establishment for the purpose of depleting the profits that would otherwise have been attributable to the permanent establishment and<p><a name="P4S175"></a></p>

(i) the profits of the permanent establishment are not determined on the basis of the total amount received by the enterprise, but are determined on the basis of the remuneration which it is expected to make if it were a distinct and independent enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions;<p><a name="P4S176"></a></p>

(ii) the profits of such permanent establishment are not determined on the basis of the total amount of the contract, but are determined on the basis of that part of the contract which is effectively carried out by the permanent establishment.<p><a name="P4S177"></a></p>

Article 8<br />
   1. If the competent authorities of the Contracting States by mutual agreement conclude that profits are derived by a resident or residents of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic to or from places in the other Contracting State and that such profits are not derived by a resident or residents of the other Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic to or from places in the first-mentioned State, and that such situation has a permanent nature, then the condition of reciprocity envisaged in paragraph 1 of Article 8 for tax exemption is not met. In such case the tax charged shall not exceed 1 per cent of the earnings of the enterprise derived from the other Contracting State. For the purpose of the foregoing sentence, the term "earnings" means income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the carriage of passengers, mail, livestock or goods boarded or loaded in the other Contracting State, less refunds and payments of wages and salaries of ground staff and excluding income derived from the carriage of passengers, mail, livestock or goods which are brought to that other State solely for transhipments or transfers.<br />
   2. If any agreement or convention for the avoidance of double taxation, or protocol thereto, or any other international arrangement concluded after the date of the signing of this Agreement between Nigeria and a third State provides for rates of taxation (including nil rates) on the profits derived from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic which are lower than the rate provided for under this Protocol, then the same lower rate shall apply under this Agreement and shall have effect from the latter of the dates of which this Agreement or the relevant convention, agreement, protocol or other international arrangement between Nigeria and a third state becomes effective.<p><a name="P4S178"></a></p><h4 name="Articles 10, 11 and 12"><a name="Articles 10, 11 and 12">Articles 10, 11 and 12</a></h4><p><a name="P4S179"></a></p>

In respect of paragraph 6 of Article 10, paragraph 8 of Article 11 and paragraph 7 of Article 12, it is agreed that when a Contracting State contemplates to deny benefits to a resident of the other Contracting State, the competent authorities should consult with each other.<p><a name="P4S180"></a></p>

It is agreed that if any agreement or convention between Nigeria and a member state of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) provides that Nigeria shall exempt from tax dividends, interest or royalties (either generally or in respect of specific categories of dividends, interest or royalties) arising in Nigeria, or limit the tax charged in Nigeria on such dividends, interest or royalties
(either generally or in respect of specific categories of dividends, interest or royalties) to a rate lower than that provided for in sub-paragraph (a) of paragraph 2 of Article 10, paragraph 2 of Article 11 or paragraph 2 of Article 12 of the Agreement, such exemption or lower rate shall automatically apply to dividends, interest or royalties (either generally or in respect of those specific categories of dividends, interest or royalties) arising in Nigeria and beneficially owned by a resident of Sweden and dividends, interest or royalties (either generally or in respect of those specific categories of dividends, interest or royalties) arising in Sweden and beneficially owned by a resident of Nigeria, under the same conditions as if such exemption or lower rate had been specified in those sub-paragraph or paragraphs.<p><a name="P4S181"></a></p>

Hemvist<br />
   1. Vid tillämpningen av detta avtal avser uttrycket "person med hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat" person som enligt lagstiftningen i denna stat är skattskyldig där på grund av domicil, bosättning, plats för företagsledning, bolagsbildning eller annan liknande omständighet och innefattar också denna stat, dess offentligrättsliga organ eller institutioner, politiska underavdelningar eller lokala myndigheter.

   3. Då på grund av bestämmelserna i punkt 1 i denna artikel annan person än fysisk person har hemvist i båda avtalsslutande staterna, skall de behöriga myndigheterna i de avtalsslutande staterna söka avgöra frågan genom ömsesidig överenskommelse.<p><a name="P4S200"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 5"><a name="Artikel 5">Artikel 5</a></h4><p><a name="P4S201"></a></p>

Fast driftställe<br />
   1. Vid tillämpningen av detta avtal avser uttrycket "fast driftställe" en stadigvarande plats för affärsverksamhet, från vilken ett företags verksamhet helt eller delvis bedrivs.<br />
   2. Uttrycket "fast driftställe" innefattar särskilt:<br />
      a) plats för företagsledning,<br />
      b) filial,<br />
      c) kontor,<br />
      d) fabrik,<br />
      e) verkstad,<br />
      f) gruva, olje- eller gaskälla, stenbrott eller annan plats för utvinning av naturtillgångar,<br />
      g) plats för byggnads-, anläggnings-, monterings- eller installationsverksamhet och verksamhet som består av övervakning i anslutning därtill, men endast om verksamheten pågår längre tid än sex månader, och<br />
      h) tillhandahållandet av tjänster, inklusive konsulttjänster, av ett företag genom anställda eller annan personal som anlitas av företaget för sådant ändamål, men endast om sådan verksamhet pågår (avseende samma eller en därtill hörande verksamhet) inom en avtalsslutande stat under en tidsperiod eller tidsperioder som sammanlagt överstiger sex månader inom en tolvmånadersperiod.<br />
   3. Utan hinder av föregående bestämmelser i denna artikel anses uttrycket "fast driftställe" inte innefatta:<br />
      a) användningen av anordningar uteslutande för lagring eller utställning av företaget tillhöriga varor,<br />
      b) innehavet av ett företaget tillhörigt varulager uteslutande för lagring eller utställning,<br />
      c) innehavet av ett företaget tillhörigt varulager uteslutande för bearbetning eller förädling genom annat företags försorg,<br />
      d) innehavet av stadigvarande plats för affärsverksamhet uteslutande för inköp av varor eller inhämtande av upplysningar för företaget,<br />
      e) innehavet av en stadigvarande plats för affärsverksamhet uteslutande för att för företaget bedriva annan verksamhet av förberedande eller biträdande art,<br />
      f) innehavet av en stadigvarande plats för affärsverksamhet uteslutande för någon kombination av verksamheter som anges i a) till e) ovan, under förutsättning att hela den verksamhet som bedrivs vid den stadigvarande platsen för affärsverksamhet på grund av denna kombination är av förberedande eller biträdande art.<br />
   4. Uttrycket "fast driftställe" skall anses innefatta en stadigvarande plats för affärsverksamhet som används som försäljningsställe oavsett om denna stadigvarande plats för affärsverksamhet i övrigt används för verksamheter som anges i punkt 3 i denna artikel.<br />
   5. Företag i en avtalsslutande stat anses inte ha fast driftställe i den andra avtalsslutande staten endast på den grund att företaget bedriver affärsverksamhet i denna stat genom förmedling av mäklare, kommissionär eller annan oberoende representant, under förutsättning att sådana personer därvid bedriver sin sedvanliga affärsverksamhet.<br />
   6. En person, som inte är en sådan oberoende representant på vilken punkt 5 i denna artikel tillämpas, och som är verksam i en avtalsslutande stat för ett företag i den andra avtalsslutande staten skall, om inte den verksamhet som personen bedriver är begränsad till sådan som anges i punkt 3 i denna artikel och som, om den bedrevs från en stadigvarande plats för affärsverksamhet, inte skulle göra denna stadigvarande plats för affärsverksamhet till fast driftställe enligt bestämmelserna i nämnda punkt, anses utgöra ett fast driftställe för detta företag i den förstnämnda staten om:<br />
      a) personen har och i denna stat regelmässigt använder fullmakt att sluta avtal eller där bedriver affärsverksamhet i företagets namn, eller<br />
      b) personen regelmässigt säkrar order för försäljning av varor i denna stat uteslutande eller nästan uteslutande för detta företags räkning eller andra företag som kontrolleras av det eller innehar en kontrollerande andel av det.<br />
   7. Den omständigheten att ett bolag med hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat kontrollerar eller kontrolleras av ett bolag med hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten eller ett bolag som bedriver affärsverksamhet i denna andra stat
(antingen från fast driftställe eller på annat sätt), medför inte i och för sig att någotdera bolaget utgör fast driftställe för det andra.<p><a name="P4S202"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 6"><a name="Artikel 6">Artikel 6</a></h4><p><a name="P4S203"></a></p>

Inkomst av fast egendom<br />
   1. Inkomst, som person med hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat förvärvar av fast egendom (däri inbegripet inkomst av lantbruk eller skogsbruk) belägen i den andra avtalsslutande staten, får beskattas i denna andra stat.<br />
   2. Uttrycket "fast egendom" har den betydelse som uttrycket har enligt lagstiftningen i den avtalsslutande stat där egendomen är belägen. Uttrycket inbegriper dock alltid tillbehör till fast egendom, levande och döda inventarier i lantbruk och skogsbruk, rättigheter på vilka bestämmelserna i privaträtten om fast egendom tillämpas, byggnader, nyttjanderätt till fast egendom samt rätt till föränderliga eller fasta ersättningar för nyttjandet av eller rätten att nyttja mineralförekomst, källa eller annan naturtillgång. Skepp, båtar och luftfartyg anses inte vara fast egendom.<br />
   3. Bestämmelserna i punkt 1 i denna artikel tillämpas på inkomst som förvärvas genom omedelbart brukande, genom uthyrning eller annan användning av fast egendom.<br />
   4. Bestämmelserna i punkterna 1 och 3 i denna artikel tillämpas även på inkomst av fast egendom som tillhör företag.<p><a name="P4S204"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 7"><a name="Artikel 7">Artikel 7</a></h4><p><a name="P4S205"></a></p>

Inkomst av rörelse<br />
   1. Inkomst av rörelse, som företag i en avtalsslutande stat förvärvar, beskattas endast i denna stat, såvida inte företaget bedriver rörelse i den andra avtalsslutande staten från där beläget fast driftställe. Om företaget bedriver rörelse på nyss angivet sätt, får företagets inkomst beskattas i den andra staten, men endast så stor del därav som är hänförlig till:<br />
      a) det fasta driftstället,<br />
      b) försäljning i denna andra stat av varor av samma eller liknande slag som de som säljs genom det fasta driftstället, eller<br />
      c) annan affärsverksamhet som bedrivs i denna andra stat vilken är av samma eller liknande slag som den som bedrivs genom det fasta driftstället.<br />
   2. Om företag i en avtalsslutande stat bedriver rörelse i den andra avtalsslutande staten från där beläget fast driftställe hänförs, om inte bestämmelserna i punkt 3 i denna artikel föranleder annat, i vardera avtalsslutande staten till det fasta driftstället den inkomst som det kan antas att driftstället skulle ha förvärvat, om det varit ett fristående företag, som bedrivit verksamhet av samma eller liknande slag under samma eller liknande villkor och självständigt avslutat affärer med det företag till vilket driftstället hör.<br />
   3. Vid bestämmandet av fast driftställes inkomst medges avdrag för utgifter som kan visas ha uppkommit för det fasta driftstället, härunder inbegripna utgifter för företagets ledning och allmänna förvaltning, oavsett om utgifterna uppkommit i den stat där det fasta driftstället är beläget eller annorstädes. Avdrag medges emellertid inte för belopp, om något, som det fasta driftstället betalat till företagets huvudkontor eller något av dess andra kontor (om inte beloppen utgör ersättning för faktiska utgifter) i form av royalty, avgifter eller andra liknande betalningar för nyttjandet av patent eller andra rättigheter, eller i form av ersättning för särskilda tjänster eller för företagsledning, eller, utom i fråga om bankföretag, i form av ränta på kapital utlånat till det fasta driftstället. På samma sätt skall, vid bestämmandet av det fasta driftställets inkomst, inte beaktas belopp som det fasta driftstället debiterat företagets huvudkontor eller något av dess andra kontor (om inte beloppen utgör ersättning för faktiska utgifter) i form av royalty, avgifter eller andra liknande betalningar för nyttjandet av patent eller andra rättigheter, eller i form av ersättning för särskilda tjänster eller företagsledning, eller, utom i fråga om bankföretag, i form av ränta på kapital utlånat till företagets huvudkontor eller något annat av dess kontor.<br />
   4. Inkomst hänförs inte till fast driftställe endast av den anledningen att varor inköps genom det fasta driftställets försorg för företaget. Detta gäller under förutsättning att, i fall då det fasta driftstället även används som försäljningsställe för de varor som köps in, inkomster som uppkommer vid sådan försäljning hänförs till det fasta driftstället. Vid tillämpningen av denna punkt skall uttrycket försäljningsställe anses ha samma innebörd som i artikel 5 punkt 4.<br />
   5. Vid tillämpningen av föregående punkter bestäms inkomst som är hänförlig till det fasta driftstället genom samma förfarande år från år, såvida inte goda och tillräckliga skäl föranleder annat.<br />
   6. Ingår i inkomst av rörelse inkomst som behandlas särskilt i andra artiklar av detta avtal, berörs bestämmelserna i dessa artiklar inte av bestämmelserna i denna artikel<p><a name="P4S206"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 8"><a name="Artikel 8">Artikel 8</a></h4><p><a name="P4S207"></a></p>

Sjöfart och luftfart<br />
   1. En person med hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat skall, under förutsättning av ömsesidighet, undantas från beskattning i den andra avtalsslutande staten på inkomst eller vinst som förvärvas genom användningen av skepp eller luftfartyg i internationell trafik.<br />
   2. Bestämmelserna i punkt 1 i denna artikel tillämpas på inkomst som förvärvas av luftfartskonsortiet Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) men endast i fråga om den del av inkomsten som motsvarar den andel av konsortiet som innehas av SAS Sverige AB, den svenske delägaren i SAS.<br />
   3. Bestämmelserna i punkt 1 i denna artikel tillämpas även på inkomster som förvärvas genom deltagande i en pool, ett gemensamt företag eller en internationell driftsorganisation.<p><a name="P4S208"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 9"><a name="Artikel 9">Artikel 9</a></h4><p><a name="P4S209"></a></p>

Företag med intressegemenskap<br />
   1. I fall då<br />
      a) ett företag i en avtalsslutande stat direkt eller indirekt deltar i ledningen eller kontrollen av ett företag i den andra avtalsslutande staten eller äger del i detta företags kapital, eller<br />
      b) samma personer direkt eller indirekt deltar i ledningen eller kontrollen av såväl ett företag i en avtalsslutande stat som ett företag i den andra avtalsslutande staten eller äger del i båda dessa företags kapital, iakttas följande.<p><a name="P4S210"></a></p>

Om mellan företagen i fråga om handelsförbindelser eller finansiella förbindelser avtalas eller föreskrivs villkor, som avviker från dem som skulle ha avtalats mellan av varandra oberoende företag, får all inkomst, som utan sådana villkor skulle ha tillkommit det ena företaget men som på grund av villkoren i fråga inte tillkommit detta företag, inräknas i detta företags inkomst och beskattas i överensstämmelse därmed.<br />
   2. I fall då en avtalsslutande stat i inkomsten för ett företag i denna stat inräknar - och i överensstämmelse därmed beskattar
- inkomst, för vilken ett företag i den andra avtalsslutande staten beskattats i denna andra stat, samt den sålunda inräknade inkomsten är sådan som skulle ha tillkommit företaget i den förstnämnda staten om de villkor som avtalats mellan företagen hade varit sådana som skulle ha avtalats mellan av varandra oberoende företag, skall denna andra stat genomföra vederbörlig justering av det skattebelopp som påförts för inkomsten där. Vid sådan justering iakttas övriga bestämmelser i detta avtal och de behöriga myndigheterna i de avtalsslutande staterna överlägger vid behov med varandra.<p><a name="P4S211"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 10"><a name="Artikel 10">Artikel 10</a></h4><p><a name="P4S212"></a></p>

Utdelning<br />
   1. Utdelning från bolag med hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat till person med hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten får beskattas i denna andra stat.<br />
   2. Utdelningen får emellertid beskattas även i den avtalsslutande stat där bolaget som betalar utdelningen har hemvist, enligt lagstiftningen i denna stat. Om den som har rätt till utdelningen har hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten får skatten inte överstiga:<br />
      a) 7,5 procent av utdelningens bruttobelopp, om den som har rätt till utdelningen är ett bolag (med undantag för handelsbolag) som direkt innehar minst 10 procent av det utbetalande bolagets kapital,<br />
      b) 10 procent av utdelningens bruttobelopp i övriga fall.<p><a name="P4S213"></a></p>

De behöriga myndigheterna i de avtalsslutande staterna kan träffa överenskommelse om sättet att genomföra dessa begränsningar.<p><a name="P4S214"></a></p>

Denna punkt berör inte bolagets beskattning för den vinst av vilken utdelningen betalas.<br />
   3. Med uttrycket "utdelning" förstås i denna artikel inkomst av aktier eller andra rättigheter, som inte är fordringar, med rätt till andel i vinst, samt inkomst av andra rättigheter i bolag som enligt lagstiftningen i den stat där det utdelande bolaget har hemvist vid beskattningen behandlas på samma sätt som inkomst av aktier.<br />
   4. Bestämmelserna i punkterna 1 och 2 i denna artikel tillämpas inte, om den som har rätt till utdelningen har hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat och bedriver rörelse i den andra avtalsslutande staten, där bolaget som betalar utdelningen har hemvist, från där beläget fast driftställe, samt den andel på grund av vilken utdelningen betalas äger verkligt samband med det fasta driftstället.

I sådant fall tillämpas bestämmelserna i artikel 7.<br />
   5. Royalty anses härröra från en avtalsslutande stat om utbetalaren är en person med hemvist i denna stat. Om emellertid den person som betalar royaltyn, antingen han har hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat eller inte, i en avtalsslutande stat har fast driftställe i samband varmed skyldigheten att betala royaltyn uppkommit, och royaltyn belastar det fasta driftstället, anses royaltyn härröra från den stat där det fasta driftstället finns.<br />

Då på grund av särskilda förbindelser mellan utbetalaren och den som har rätt till royaltyn eller mellan dem båda och annan person royaltybeloppet, med hänsyn till det nyttjande, den rättighet eller den upplysning för vilken royaltyn betalas, överstiger det belopp som skulle ha avtalats mellan utbetalaren och den som har rätt till royaltyn om sådana förbindelser inte förelegat, tillämpas bestämmelserna i denna artikel endast på sistnämnda belopp. I sådant fall beskattas överskjutande belopp enligt lagstiftningen i vardera avtalsslutande staten med iakttagande av övriga bestämmelser i detta avtal.<br />

Vid undertecknandet av avtalet för undvikande av dubbelbeskattning och förhindrande av skatteflykt beträffande skatter på inkomst och på kapitalvinst mellan Konungariket Sverige och Federala Republiken Nigeria, har de avtalsslutande staterna kommit överens om att följande bestämmelser skall utgöra en integrerande del av avtalet:<p><a name="P4S268"></a></p>

Artikel 5<br />
   1. Om en överenskommelse eller ett avtal mellan Nigeria och en medlemsstat i Organisationen för ekonomiskt samarbete och utveckling (OECD) föreskriver en längre tidsperiod än någon av dem som föreskrivs i artikel 5 punkt 2 g) eller h) (antingen generellt eller i förhållande till särskilda aktiviteter), skall sådan längre tidsperiod eller sådana längre tidsperioder automatiskt tillämpas (antingen generellt eller i förhållande till särskilda aktiviteter) om en person med hemvist i Nigeria bedriver sådan verksamhet i Sverige eller om en person med hemvist i Sverige bedriver sådan verksamhet i Nigeria, på samma sätt som om sådan längre tidsperiod eller sådana längre tidsperioder hade föreskrivits i dessa punkter.<br />
   2. Om en överenskommelse eller ett avtal mellan Nigeria och en medlemsstat i Organisationen för ekonomiskt samarbete och utveckling (OECD), som undertecknas efter undertecknandet av detta avtal, ordet "utlämnande" inkluderas i en bestämmelse eller i bestämmelser som motsvarar artikel 5 punkt 3 a) eller b), eller i båda dessa punkter, skall artikel 5 punkt 3 a) och b) automatiskt tillämpas som om ordet "utlämnande" hade inkluderats på detta sätt från och med den tidpunkt då avtalet mellan Nigeria och denna tredje stat börjar att tillämpas.<p><a name="P4S269"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 7"><a name="Artikel 7">Artikel 7</a></h4><p><a name="P4S270"></a></p>

Bestämmelserna i artikel 7 punkt 1 b) och c) tillämpas endast i fall då företagets försäljning och affärsverksamhet i den andra avtalsslutande staten påverkas negativt på grund av att andra försäljningsställen än det fasta driftstället gynnas genom att tillföras inkomster som annars skulle ha varit hänförliga till det fasta driftstället, och<br />
      1) inkomsterna i det fasta driftstället inte bestäms på grundval av det totala beloppet som företaget erhåller utan på grundval av den ersättning som driftstället kan antas ha erhållit om det varit ett fristående företag, som bedrivit verksamhet av samma eller liknande slag under samma eller liknande villkor,<br />
      2) inkomsterna i ett sådant fast driftställe inte bestäms på grundval av den totala kontraktssumman utan på grundval av den del av kontraktet som fullgörs vid det fasta driftstället.<p><a name="P4S271"></a></p>

Artikel 8<br />
   1. Om de behöriga myndigheterna i de avtalsslutande staterna genom ömsesidig överenskommelse enas om att inkomst som förvärvas av en eller flera personer med hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat från användningen av skepp eller luftfartyg i internationell trafik till eller från platser i den andra avtalsslutande staten och att motsvarande inkomster inte förvärvas av en eller flera personer med hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten från användningen av skepp eller luftfartyg i internationell trafik till eller från platser i den förstnämnda staten, samt att detta förhållande är av permanent natur, anses kravet på ömsesidighet som föreskrivs i artikel 8 punkt 1 för skattebefrielse inte uppfyllt. Vid sådant förhållande skall den skatt som tas ut inte överstiga en procent av de inkomster som företaget förvärvar från den andra avtalsslutande staten. Vid tilllämpningen av föregående mening skall med uttrycket "inkomst", förstås inkomst som förvärvas av en person med hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat från transport av passagerare, post, boskap eller gods som stiger ombord eller lastas i den andra avtalsslutande staten med avdrag för återbetalningar, löner avseende markpersonal och med bortseende från inkomster som förvärvats för transport av passagerare, post, boskap eller gods som ankommit till denna andra stat uteslutande för omlastning eller transfer.<br />
   2. Om en överenskommelse eller ett avtal för undvikande av dubbelbeskattning, eller därtill hörande protokoll, eller någon annan internationell överenskommelse som undertecknas efter dagen för undertecknandet av detta avtal, mellan Nigeria och en tredje stat, föreskriver skattesatser (inklusive nollskattesats) på inkomster från användningen av skepp eller luftfartyg i internationell trafik som är lägre än den som anges i detta protokoll, skall denna lägre skattesats tillämpas även med avseende på detta avtal från den senare tidpunkt då antingen detta avtal eller ifrågavarande överenskommelse, avtal, protokoll eller annan internationell överenskommelse mellan Nigeria och denna tredje stat börjar att tillämpas.<p><a name="P4S272"></a></p><h4 name="Artiklarna 10, 11 och 12"><a name="Artiklarna 10, 11 och 12">Artiklarna 10, 11 och 12</a></h4><p><a name="P4S273"></a></p>

I fråga om artikel 10 punkt 6, artikel 11 punkt 8 och artikel 12 punkt 7 gäller att när en avtalsslutande stat överväger att neka en person med hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten förmåner skall de behöriga myndigheterna överlägga med varandra.<p><a name="P4S274"></a></p>

Om en överenskommelse eller ett avtal mellan Nigeria och en medlemsstat i Organisationen för ekonomiskt samarbete och utveckling (OECD) föreskriver att Nigeria skall skattebefria utdelning, ränta eller royalty (antingen generellt eller i förhållande till särskilda kategorier av utdelning, ränta eller royalty) härrörande från Nigeria, eller begränsa den skatt som tas ut i Nigeria avseende sådan utdelning, ränta eller royalty
(antingen generellt eller i förhållande till särskilda kategorier av utdelning, ränta eller royalty) till en skattesats som understiger den som föreskrivs i artikel 10 punkt 2 a), artikel 11 punkt 2 eller artikel 12 punkt 2 i detta avtal, skall sådan skattebefrielse eller lägre skattesats automatiskt tillämpas avseende utdelning, ränta eller royalty
(antingen generellt eller i förhållande till dessa särskilda kategorier av utdelning, ränta eller royalty) härrörande från Nigeria och som betalas till en person med hemvist i Sverige som har rätt till denna och utdelningar, ränta och royalty
(antingen generellt eller i förhållande till dessa särskilda kategorier av utdelningar, ränta eller royalty) härrörande från Sverige och som betalas till en person med hemvist i Nigeria som har rätt till denna, på samma villkor som om sådan skattebefrielse eller sådan lägre skattesats hade föreskrivits i nämnda punkter.<p><a name="P4S275"></a></p>

Till bekräftelse härav har undertecknade, därtill vederbörligen bemyndigade, undertecknat detta protokoll.<p><a name="P4S276"></a></p>
