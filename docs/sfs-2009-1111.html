- skulle kunna inhämta upplysningarna enligt lagstiftning  eller vedertagen administrativ praxis i den anmodande parten  samt att begäran är i överensstämmelse med detta avtal,<br />
      g) uppgift om att den anmodande parten har vidtagit alla  åtgärder för att inhämta upplysningarna som står till dess  förfogande inom dess eget territorium, utom sådana åtgärder  som skulle medföra oproportionerligt stora svårigheter. <br />
   6. Den behöriga myndigheten i den anmodade parten ska snarast  möjligt lämna de begärda upplysningarna till den anmodande  parten. För att tillgodose ett skyndsamt svar ska den  behöriga myndigheten i den anmodade parten:<br />
      a) Till den behöriga myndigheten i den anmodande parten  skriftligen bekräfta mottagandet av begäran och inom 60 dagar  efter mottagandet underrätta den behöriga myndigheten i den  anmodande parten om eventuella brister i begäran.<br />
      b) Om den behöriga myndigheten i den anmodade parten inte har  kunnat inhämta och lämna de begärda upplysningarna inom 
90 dagar från det att begäran togs emot, däri inbegripet om  det föreligger förhinder att tillhandahålla upplysningarna  eller om den behöriga myndigheten vägrar att tillhandahålla  upplysningarna, ska den omedelbart underrätta den anmodande  parten om detta och ange skälen för att den inte kunnat  inhämta och tillhandahålla upplysningarna, vilka hinder som  föreligger eller skälen för dess vägran.
