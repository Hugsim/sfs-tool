Parternas behöriga myndigheter ska  meddela varandra de väsentliga ändringar som gjorts i  respektive skattelagstiftning beträffande fysiska personer.<p><a name="P3S35"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 3"><a name="Artikel 3">Artikel 3</a></h4><p><a name="P3S36"></a></p>

Allmänna definitioner<br />
   1. Om inte sammanhanget föranleder annat, har vid  tillämpningen av detta avtal följande uttryck nedan angiven  betydelse:<br />
      a) "en part" avser Caymanöarna eller Sverige, beroende på  sammanhanget; 
"parterna" avser Caymanöarna och Sverige,<br />
      b) "Caymanöarna" avser Caymanöarnas territorium och  innefattar dess territorialvatten och varje annat område inom  vilket Caymanöarna, i överensstämmelse med folkrättens  regler, äger  utöva rättigheter med avseende på havsbottnen och dess  underlag och  därtill hörande naturtillgångar,<br />
      c) "Sverige" avser Konungariket Sverige och innefattar, när  uttrycket används i geografisk betydelse, Sveriges  territorium, Sveriges territorialvatten och andra havsområden  över vilka Sverige, i överensstämmelse med folkrättens  regler, utövar suveräna  rättigheter eller jurisdiktion,
  d) "behörig myndighet" avser:<br />
      1) i Caymanöarna: "the Tax Information Authority" eller den  person eller myndighet som denna utnämner,<br />

   2. Då en part tillämpar avtalet vid någon tidpunkt anses,  såvida inte sammanhanget föranleder annat, varje uttryck som  inte definierats i avtalet ha den betydelse som uttrycket har  vid denna tidpunkt enligt den partens lagstiftning och den  betydelse som uttrycket har enligt tillämplig  skattelagstiftning  i denna part äger företräde framför den  betydelse uttrycket har enligt annan lagstiftning i denna  part.<p><a name="P3S37"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 4"><a name="Artikel 4">Artikel 4</a></h4><p><a name="P3S38"></a></p>

Hemvist<br />
   1. Vid tillämpningen av detta avtal avser uttrycket "person  med hemvist i en part":<br />
      a) i Sverige, såvitt avser fysisk person, varje fysisk person  som enligt lagstiftningen i Sverige är skattskyldig där på  grund av domicil, bosättning eller annan liknande  omständighet. Detta uttryck inbegriper emellertid inte  fysisk person som är skattskyldig i Sverige endast för  inkomst som har källa i Sverige,
  b) i Caymanöarna, så vitt avser fysisk person, varje fysisk  person som enligt dess lagstiftning har hemvist där på grund  av domicil, bosättning eller annan liknande omständighet.
<pre></pre>
2. Då en fysisk person på grund av bestämmelserna i punkt 1  har hemvist i båda parterna, bestäms hans hemvist på följande  sätt:<br />
      a) han anses ha hemvist endast i den part där han har en  bostad som stadigvarande står till hans förfogande. Om han  har en sådan bostad i båda parterna, anses han ha hemvist  endast  i den part med vilken hans personliga och ekonomiska  förbindelser är starkast (centrum för levnadsintressena), <br />
      b) om det inte kan avgöras i vilken part han har centrum för  sina levnadsintressen eller om han inte i någondera parten  har  en bostad som stadigvarande står till hans förfogande, anses  han ha hemvist endast i den part där han stadigvarande  vistas,¨
<pre></pre>
c) om han stadigvarande vistas i båda parterna eller inte  vistas stadigvarande i någon av dem, ska de behöriga  myndigheterna avgöra frågan genom ömsesidig  överenskommelse.<p><a name="P3S39"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 5"><a name="Artikel 5">Artikel 5</a></h4><p><a name="P3S40"></a></p>

Om arbetet utförts i denna andra part, får ersättning  som  uppbärs för arbetet beskattas där.<br />
   2. Utan hinder av bestämmelserna i punkt 1, beskattas  ersättning som person med hemvist i en part uppbär för arbete  som utförts i den andra parten, endast i den förstnämnda  parten, om<br />
      a) mottagaren vistas i den andra parten under tidsperiod  eller tidsperioder som sammanlagt inte överstiger 183 dagar  under en tolvmånadersperiod som börjar eller slutar under  beskattningsåret i fråga, och<br />

Undanröjande av dubbelbeskattning<br />
   1. I Caymanöarna ska dubbelbeskattning undanröjas i enlighet  med lagstiftningen i Caymanöarna.<br />
   2. I Sverige ska dubbelbeskattning undanröjas på följande  sätt:<br />
      a) Om en person med hemvist i Sverige förvärvar inkomst som  enligt lagstiftningen i Caymanöarna och i enlighet med  bestämmelserna i detta avtal får beskattas i Caymanöarna, ska  Sverige-med beaktande av bestämmelserna i svensk  lagstiftning beträffande avräkning av utländsk skatt(även i  den lydelse de kan få genom att ändras utan att den allmänna  princip som anges här ändras)-från den svenska skatten  avräkna ett belopp motsvarande skatten i Caymanöarna som  erlagts på inkomsten.<br />
      b) Om en person med hemvist i Sverige förvärvar inkomst som  enligt bestämmelserna i detta avtal beskattas endast i  Caymanöarna, får Sverige vid bestämmandet av svensk  progressiv skatt beakta sådan inkomst som beskattas endast i  Caymanöarna.<p><a name="P3S55"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 12"><a name="Artikel 12">Artikel 12</a></h4><p><a name="P3S56"></a></p>

Förfarandet vid ömsesidig överenskommelse<br />
   1. Om en fysisk person anser att en part eller båda parterna  vidtagit åtgärder som för honom medför eller kommer att  medföra beskattning som strider mot bestämmelserna i detta  avtal, kan han, utan att det påverkar hans rätt att använda  sig av de rättsmedel som finns i dessa parters interna  rättsordning, lägga fram saken för den behöriga myndigheten i  den part där han har hemvist. Saken ska läggas fram inom tre  år från den tidpunkt då personen i fråga fick vetskap om den  åtgärd som givit upphov till beskattning som strider mot  bestämmelserna i avtalet.<br />
   2. Om den behöriga myndigheten finner invändningen grundad  men inte själv kan få till stånd en tillfredsställande  lösning, ska myndigheten söka avgöra saken genom ömsesidig  överenskommelse med den behöriga myndigheten i den andra  parten i syfte att undvika beskattning som strider mot  avtalet. Överenskommelse som träffats genomförs utan hinder  av tidsgränser i parternas interna lagstiftning.<br />
   3. Parternas behöriga myndigheter ska genom ömsesidig  överenskommelse söka avgöra svårigheter eller tvivelsmål som  uppkommer i fråga om tolkningen eller tillämpningen av  avtalet.<br />
   4. Parternas behöriga myndigheter kan träda i direkt  förbindelse med varandra i syfte att träffa överenskommelse i  den mening som avses i föregående punkter.
