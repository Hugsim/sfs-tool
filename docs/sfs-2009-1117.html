Utbyte av upplysningar på begäran<br />
   1. Den behöriga myndigheten i den anmodade parten ska på  begäran lämna upplysningar för de ändamål som anges i artikel 
1. Sådana upplysningar ska utbytas utan avseende på om det  handlande som är föremål för utredning skulle ha utgjort ett  brott enligt den anmodade partens lagstiftning om ett sådant  handlande utförts i den anmodade parten. <br />
   2. Om de upplysningar som är tillgängliga för den behöriga  myndigheten i den anmodade parten inte räcker till för att  tillmötesgå en begäran om upplysningar, ska den anmodade  parten - utan hinder av att den anmodade parten kanske inte  har behov av upplysningarna för sina egna beskattningsändamål 
- utnyttja alla relevanta åtgärder för att inhämta  upplysningarna till den anmodande parten.<br />
   3. Om den behöriga myndigheten i den anmodande parten  särskilt begär det, ska den behöriga myndigheten i den  anmodade parten - i den utsträckning som detta är  tillåtet enligt dess interna lagstiftning - lämna  upplysningar enligt denna artikel i form av upptagande av  vittnesberättelser och bestyrkta kopior av handlingar.<br />
   4. Vardera parten ska säkerställa att dess behöriga  myndighet, för tillämpningen av detta avtal, har befogenhet  att på begäran inhämta och lämna:<br />
      a) upplysningar som innehas av banker, andra finansiella  institutioner och annan person, däri inbegripet ombud och  trustförvaltare som agerar i egenskap av representant eller  förvaltare,<br />

   5. Detta avtal medför inte en skyldighet för parterna att  inhämta eller lämna:<br />
      a) upplysningar om ägarförhållandena i bolag vars aktier är  föremål för allmän omsättning eller i publika kollektiva  investeringsfonder eller i publika kollektiva  investeringssystem, såvida inte sådana upplysningar kan  inhämtas utan att det medför oproportionerligt stora  svårigheter,<br />
      b) upplysningar som avser tid mer än sex år före det  beskattningsår som är föremål för utredning,<br />

      d) upplysningar som annan person än den skattskyldige innehar  eller kan inhämta och som inte direkt avser den  skattskyldige. <br />
   6. När den anmodande parten begär upplysningar rörande  frågor som inte avser ett allvarligt skatteundandragande, ska  en tjänsteman vid dess behöriga myndighet intyga att begäran  är relevant och nödvändig för fastställandet av den  skattskyldiges skattskyldighet enligt lagstiftningen i den  anmodande parten.<br />
   7. Om upplysningar begärs som avser en person som varken har  hemvist eller är medborgare i någon av parterna, ska det för  den behöriga myndigheten i den anmodade parten på ett  tillfredsställande sätt styrkas att sådana upplysningar är  nödvändiga för en korrekt tillämpning och verkställighet av  skattelagstiftningen i den anmodande parten. <br />
   8. Vid begäran om upplysningar enligt detta avtal ska den  behöriga myndigheten i den anmodande parten till den  behöriga myndigheten i den anmodade parten lämna följande  upplysningar, för att visa att de efterfrågade upplysningarna  är relevanta:<br />
      a) identiteten på den skattskyldige som är föremål för  utredning eller undersökning,<br />
      b) skälen för att anta att de begärda upplysningarna  innehas eller kan inhämtas av person inom den anmodade  partens jurisdiktion,<br />
      c) såvitt det är känt, namn och adress på person som kan  antas inneha eller kunna inhämta de begärda upplysningarna,<br />
      d) uppgift om att ansökan är i överensstämmelse med  lagstiftning och administrativ praxis i den anmodande parten  och att upplysningarna skulle kunna inhämtas av den anmodande  parten enligt sin lagstiftning under liknande omständigheter,  både inom ramen för att bestämma sitt eget skatteanspråk och  för att tillmötesgå en giltig begäran från den anmodade  parten enligt detta avtal,<br />
      e) uppgift om att den anmodande parten inom sitt eget  territorium har vidtagit alla åtgärder som står till dess  förfogande för att inhämta upplysningarna, utom sådana  åtgärder som skulle medföra oproportionerligt stora  svårigheter, samt, så  långt som detta är möjligt:<br />
      f) de begärda upplysningarnas närmare beskaffenhet, däri  inbegripet en beskrivning av vilka bevis, informationer eller  annat bistånd som efterfrågas och, om det är möjligt, i  vilken form som den anmodande parten föredrar att få  upplysningarna, <br />
      g) de beskattningsändamål för vilka de begärda  upplysningarna efterfrågas och varför de är relevanta för att  avgöra en skattskyldigs skattskyldighet enligt lagstiftningen  i den anmodande parten,<br />

   9. Den behöriga myndigheten i den anmodade parten ska snarast  möjligt lämna de begärda upplysningarna till den anmodande  parten. För att tillgodose ett skyndsamt svar ska den  anmodade parten:<br />
      a) till den behöriga myndigheten i den anmodande parten  skriftligen bekräfta mottagandet av begäran och inom 60 dagar  efter mottagandet underrätta den behöriga myndigheten i den  anmodande parten om eventuella brister i begäran, och<br />
      b) om den behöriga myndigheten i den anmodade  parten inte har kunnat inhämta och lämna de begärda  upplysningarna inom 90 dagar från det att begäran togs emot,  däri inbegripet om det föreligger förhinder att  tillhandahålla upplysningarna eller om den vägrar att  tillhandahålla upplysningarna, ska den omedelbart underrätta  den anmodande parten om detta och ange skälen till att den  inte kunnat inhämta och tillhandahålla upplysningarna,  vilka hinder som föreligger eller skälen för dess vägran. <p><a name="S61"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 6 "><a name="Artikel 6 ">Artikel 6 </a></h4><p><a name="S62"></a></p>

Utomlands utförda skatteutredningar<br />
   1. Den anmodade parten kan - i den utsträckning som detta är  tillåtet enligt dess interna lagstiftning - tillåta  representanter för den behöriga myndigheten i den anmodande  parten att närvara i den anmodade parten för att höra fysiska  personer och granska handlingar efter skriftligt medgivande  av de berörda personerna. Den behöriga myndigheten i den  anmodande parten ska underrätta den behöriga myndigheten i  den anmodade parten om tid och plats för mötet med berörda  fysiska personer.<br />
   2. På begäran av den behöriga myndigheten i den anmodande  parten får den behöriga myndigheten i den anmodade parten  låta representanter för den behöriga myndigheten i den  anmodande parten till den del detta anses lämpligt närvara  vid skatteutredning i den anmodade parten.<br />
   3. Bifalls en begäran enligt punkt 2 ska den behöriga  myndigheten i den anmodade parten som utför utredningen  snarast möjligt underrätta den behöriga myndigheten i den  anmodande parten om tid och plats för utredningen, om den  myndighet eller person som bemyndigats att utföra  utredningen samt om de förfaranden och villkor som den  anmodade parten fastställt för utförandet av utredningen.  Alla beslut beträffande utförandet av utredningen ska fattas  av den anmodade parten som utför utredningen. <p><a name="S63"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 7"><a name="Artikel 7">Artikel 7</a></h4><p><a name="S64"></a></p>

Möjlighet att avslå en begäran <br />
   1. Den behöriga myndigheten i den anmodade parten får avslå  en begäran när:<br />
      a) begäran inte har gjorts i överensstämmelse med detta  avtal,<br />
      b) lämnandet av de begärda upplysningarna skulle strida mot  allmänna hänsyn,<br />
      c) den anmodande parten inte kan inhämta upplysningarna <br />
      1) enligt sin lagstiftning avseende tillämpning eller  verkställighet av sin skattelagstiftning, eller<br />
      2) som svar på en giltig begäran enligt detta avtal från den  anmodade parten.<br />
   2. Bestämmelserna i detta avtal ska inte  medföra skyldighet för en part att lämna upplysningar som  skulle röja handels-, affärs-, industri- eller yrkeshemlighet  eller kommersiell hemlighet eller i näringsverksamhet nyttjat  förfaringssätt. Utan hinder av detta, ska upplysningar  som avses i artikel 5 punkt 4 inte behandlas som en sådan  hemlighet eller sådant förfaringssätt endast på grund av att  de uppfyller villkoren i nämnda punkt.<br />
   3. Bestämmelserna i detta avtal ska inte medföra skyldighet  för en part att inhämta eller lämna upplysningar som  skulle röja hemlig kommunikation mellan en klient och dennes  advokat eller annat juridiskt ombud, när sådan kommunikation:<br />
      a) utgör kommunikation mellan en yrkesmässig juridisk  rådgivare och dennes klient i samband med juridisk  rådgivning,<br />
      b) utgör kommunikation mellan en yrkesmässig  juridisk rådgivare och dennes klient, mellan en yrkesmässig  juridisk rådgivare som agerar som ombud för en klients  räkning och annan person eller mellan klient och annan person  i samband med ett for the purposes of such proceedings; and  pågående eller förestående rättsligt förfarande och som avser  detta förfarande, samt<br />
      c) innehåller upplysningar som bifogats eller hänvisats till  i sådan kommunikation och som sker<br />
      1) i samband med juridisk rådgivning, eller<br />
      2) i samband med ett pågående eller förestående rättsligt  förfarande och som avser detta förfarande, när dessa  upplysningar innehas av en person som har rätt att inneha  dem.<br />
   4. En begäran om upplysningar ska inte avslås på grund av att  den skattefordran som föranleder begäran har bestridits.<br />
   5. Den anmodade parten får avslå en begäran om upplysningar  om den anmodande parten har begärt upplysningarna för  tillämpning eller verkställighet av bestämmelse i den  anmodande partens skattelagstiftning, eller därmed  sammanhängande krav, som under samma förhållanden  diskriminerar en medborgare i den anmodade parten i  förhållande till en medborgare i den anmodande parten.<p><a name="S65"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 8"><a name="Artikel 8">Artikel 8</a></h4><p><a name="S66"></a></p><h4 name="Sekretess"><a name="Sekretess">Sekretess</a></h4><p><a name="S67"></a></p>

Upplysningar som tas emot av en part med stöd av detta avtal  ska hållas hemliga och får endast yppas för personer och  myndigheter (däri inbegripet domstolar och förvaltningsorgan)  inom den partens jurisdiktion som fastställer, uppbär eller  driver in de skatter som omfattas av avtalet eller handlägger  åtal eller överklagande i fråga om dessa skatter, samt för  personer som har till uppgift att handha frågor om yppande  och användning av upplysningar. Dessa personer eller  myndigheter får använda sådana upplysningar endast för sådana  syften. De får yppa upplysningarna vid offentlig  domstolsförhandling eller i domstolsavgöranden.  Upplysningarna får inte yppas för annan person, institution  eller myndighet eller för annan jurisdiktion utan uttryckligt  skriftligt medgivande av den behöriga myndigheten i den  anmodade parten.<p><a name="S68"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 9 "><a name="Artikel 9 ">Artikel 9 </a></h4><p><a name="S69"></a></p><h4 name="Rättigheter"><a name="Rättigheter">Rättigheter</a></h4><p><a name="S70"></a></p>

De rättigheter som tillkommer personer enligt den anmodade  partens lagstiftning eller administrativa praxis förblir  tillämpliga. Dessa rättigheter får dock inte tillämpas av den  anmodade parten på ett sätt som otillbörligt hindrar eller  försenar ett effektivt utbyte av upplysningar.<p><a name="S71"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 10"><a name="Artikel 10">Artikel 10</a></h4><p><a name="S72"></a></p><h4 name="Kostnader"><a name="Kostnader">Kostnader</a></h4><p><a name="S73"></a></p>

Fördelningen av uppkomna kostnader för handräckning (däri  inbegripet skäliga kostnader för tredje part och utomstående  rådgivare i samband med rättsprocess eller för annat ändamål)  ska parternas behöriga myndigheter komma överens om.<p><a name="S74"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 11"><a name="Artikel 11">Artikel 11</a></h4><p><a name="S75"></a></p>

Inga riktade motåtgärder<br />
   1. Om en part har anledning att anta att den andra parten  infört riktade motåtgärder som avser att motverka skadlig  skattekonkurrens och som riktar sig emot personer med hemvist  eller medborgarskap i den andra parten, ska parterna  omedelbart inleda förhandlingar för att lösa frågan.<br />
   2. En riktad motåtgärd som avser att motverka skadlig  skattekonkurrens åsyftar en åtgärd som tillämpas av en part  och som riktar sig mot personer med hemvist eller  medborgarskap i en av parterna och som motiveras med att  den andra parten inte medverkar till ett effektivt utbyte av  information eller att denna part brister i transparens när  det gäller dess lagstiftning, föreskrifter eller administrativa  praxis. Detsamma gäller om denna andra part inte tar ut någon  skatt eller om bara en symbolisk skatt tas ut och detta sker  samtidigt som något av de kriterier som nämns ovan föreligger.
<pre></pre>
3. Utan att begränsa den generella innebörden av uttrycket 
"riktade motåtgärder" inbegriper uttrycket att vägra avdrag,  avräkning, skattereduktion eller skattebefrielse, att ta ut  skatt, avgift eller annan pålaga eller att ställa särskilda  krav på dokumentationsskyldighet. Sådana åtgärder inbegriper  varje åtgärd som direkt eller indirekt påverkar  beskattningen. De inbegriper emellertid inte allmänna  åtgärder som tillämpas generellt av en part i förhållande  till bland annat medlemsstater i OECD.<p><a name="S76"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 12 "><a name="Artikel 12 ">Artikel 12 </a></h4><p><a name="S77"></a></p>

Förfarandet vid ömsesidig överenskommelse <br />
   1. Parternas behöriga myndigheter ska gemensamt söka avgöra  sådana svårigheter och tvivelsmål som uppkommer i fråga om  tolkningen och tillämpningen av detta avtal.<br />
   2. Utöver vad som framgår av punkt 1, får parternas behöriga  myndigheter ömsesidigt komma överens om förfarandena för  tillämpningen av artiklarna 5 och 6.<br />
   3. Vid tillämpningen av denna artikel kan parternas behöriga  myndigheter träda i direkt förbindelse med varandra.<p><a name="S78"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 13"><a name="Artikel 13">Artikel 13</a></h4><p><a name="S79"></a></p>

   2. Avtalet träder i kraft den trettionde dagen efter den dag  då den sista av dessa underrättelser tas emot och tillämpas<br />
      a) i skattebrottsärenden, från dagen för ikraftträdandet,  dock inte tidigare än den 1 januari 2010,<br />
      b) i alla andra ärenden som omfattas av artikel 1, för  beskattningsår som börjar den 1 januari det år som närmast  följer efter dagen för ikraftträdandet av avtalet eller  senare, eller då något beskattningsår inte föreligger, för  skatteanspråk som uppkommer den 1 januari det år som  närmast följer efter dagen för ikraftträdandet av avtalet  eller senare, dock inte tidigare än den 1 januari 2010.<p><a name="S80"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 14"><a name="Artikel 14">Artikel 14</a></h4><p><a name="S81"></a></p>

Upphörande<br />
   1. Detta avtal förblir i kraft till dess det sägs upp av en  part. Vardera parten kan säga upp avtalet genom att på  diplomatisk väg lämna skriftlig underrättelse härom till den  andra parten.

PROTOKOLL TILL AVTALET MELLAN KONUNGARIKET SVERIGE OCH  BERMUDA (ENLIGT BEMYNDIGANDE FRÅN DET FÖRENADE  KONUNGARIKET STORBRITANNIEN OCH NORDIRLAND) OM UTBYTE AV  UPPLYSNINGAR AVSEENDE SKATTER<p><a name="S90"></a></p>

Vid undertecknandet av avtalet om utbyte av upplysningar  avseende skatter mellan Konungariket Sverige och Bermuda, har  parterna kommit överens om att följande bestämmelser ska  utgöra en integrerande del av avtalet:<br />
      I. Allmänt<p><a name="S91"></a></p>

Bermudas regering ska vidta nödvändiga åtgärder för att  upphäva varje bestämmelse i sin inhemska lagstiftning som  kräver att upplysningar måste finnas fysiskt tillgängliga i  syfte att uppfylla avtalet. Sveriges regering ska å sin  sida med alla tillgängliga medel söka inhämta upplysningar  inom sitt eget territorium, förutom sådana som skulle medföra  oproportionerliga svårigheter.<p><a name="S92"></a></p>

II. Till artikel 5<p><a name="S93"></a></p>

Beträffande artikel 5 punkterna 6, 7 och 8 h), ska termen 
"nödvändig" inte tolkas så att de övergripande syftena som  anges i artikel 1 begränsas. Bekräftelse av en tjänsteman är  tillräcklig för att villkoren ska anses uppfyllda i nämnda  punkter.<p><a name="S94"></a></p>

Till bekräftelse härav har undertecknade, därtill  vederbörligen bemyndigade, undertecknat detta protokoll.<p><a name="S95"></a></p>
