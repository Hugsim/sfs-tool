Allmänna definitioner<br />
   1. Om inte sammanhanget föranleder annat, har vid tillämpningen av detta avtal följande uttryck nedan angiven betydelse:<br />
      a) "en part" avser Jersey eller Sverige, beroende på sammanhanget; "parterna" avser Jersey och Sverige,<br />
      b) "Jersey" avser Bailiwick of Jersey, innefattande dess territorialvatten,<br />
      c) "Sverige" avser Konungariket Sverige och innefattar, när uttrycket används i geografisk betydelse, Sveriges territorium, Sveriges territorialvatten och andra havsområden över vilka Sverige, i överensstämmelse med folkrättens regler, utövar suveräna rättigheter eller jurisdiktion,<br />

      f) "internationell trafik" avser transport med skepp eller luftfartyg som används av företag i en part utom då skeppet eller luftfartyget används uteslutande mellan platser i den andra parten.<br />
   2. Då en part tillämpar avtalet vid någon tidpunkt anses, såvida inte sammanhanget föranleder annat, varje uttryck som inte definierats i avtalet ha den betydelse som uttrycket har vid denna tidpunkt enligt den partens lagstiftning i fråga om sådana skatter på vilka avtalet tilllämpas och den betydelse som uttrycket har enligt tillämplig skattelagstiftning i denna part äger företräde framför den betydelse som uttrycket har enligt annan lagstiftning i denna part.<p><a name="P3S86"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 4"><a name="Artikel 4">Artikel 4</a></h4><p><a name="P3S87"></a></p>

      c) om han stadigvarande vistas i båda parterna eller inte vistas stadigvarande i någon av dem, ska parternas behöriga myndigheter avgöra frågan genom ömsesidig överenskommelse.<p><a name="P3S88"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 5"><a name="Artikel 5">Artikel 5</a></h4><p><a name="P3S89"></a></p>

Undanröjande av dubbelbeskattning<br />
   1. I Jersey ska dubbelbeskattning undvikas på följande sätt:<p><a name="P3S104"></a></p>

Med beaktande av bestämmelserna i Jerseys lagstiftning som tillåter att skatt som betalats i ett annat territorium än Jersey avräknas mot skatt i Jersey (som inte ska påverka den allmänna princip som anges här),<br />
      1) om person med hemvist i Jersey förvärvar inkomst som enligt bestämmelserna i detta avtal får beskattas i Sverige, ska Jersey - med beaktande av bestämmelserna i 3) nedan - från skatten i Jersey på inkomsten för personen i fråga avräkna ett belopp motsvarande den inkomstskatt som erlagts i Sverige,<br />
      2) avräkningsbeloppet ska emellertid inte överstiga den del av inkomstskatten, beräknad före avräkning, som är hänförlig till sådan inkomst som får beskattas i Sverige,<br />
      3) om person med hemvist i Jersey förvärvar inkomst, som enligt bestämmelserna i detta avtal beskattas endast i Sverige, får Jersey inräkna inkomsten i skatteunderlaget, men ska från skatten i Jersey avräkna ett belopp motsvarande den del av inkomstskatten som är hänförlig till inkomsten som förvärvats från Sverige.<br />
   2. I Sverige ska dubbelbeskattning undvikas på följande sätt:<br />
      a) Om person med hemvist i Sverige förvärvar inkomst som enligt Jerseys lagstiftning och i enlighet med bestämmelserna i detta avtal får beskattas i Jersey, ska Sverige - med beaktande av bestämmelserna i svensk lagstiftning beträffande avräkning av utländsk skatt (såsom de kan komma att ändras från tid till annan utan att den allmänna princip som anges här ändras) - från den svenska skatten på inkomsten avräkna ett belopp motsvarande den skatt som erlagts på inkomsten i Jersey.<br />
      b) Om person med hemvist i Sverige förvärvar inkomst, som enligt bestämmelserna i detta avtal beskattas endast i Jersey, får Sverige vid bestämmandet av  svensk progressiv skatt beakta sådan inkomst som beskattas endast i Jersey.<p><a name="P3S105"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 12"><a name="Artikel 12">Artikel 12</a></h4><p><a name="P3S106"></a></p>

Förfarandet vid ömsesidig överenskommelse<br />
   1. Om en fysisk person anser att en part eller båda parterna vidtagit åtgärder som för honom medför eller kommer att medföra beskattning som strider mot bestämmelserna i detta avtal, kan han, utan att detta påverkar hans rätt att använda sig av de rättsmedel som finns i dessa parters interna rättsordning, lägga fram saken för den behöriga myndigheten i den part där han har hemvist. Saken ska läggas fram inom tre år från den tidpunkt då personen i fråga fick vetskap om den åtgärd som givit upphov till beskattning som strider mot bestämmelserna i avtalet.<br />
   2. Om den behöriga myndigheten finner invändningen grundad men inte själv kan få till stånd en tillfredsställande lösning, ska myndigheten söka avgöra saken genom ömsesidig överenskommelse med den behöriga myndigheten i den andra parten i syfte att undvika beskattning som strider mot avtalet. Överenskommelse som träffats genomförs utan hinder av tidsgränser i parternas interna lagstiftning.<br />
   3. Parternas behöriga myndigheter ska genom ömsesidig överenskommelse söka avgöra svårigheter eller tvivelsmål som uppkommer i fråga om tolkningen eller tillämpningen av avtalet.<br />

Upphörande<br />
   1. Detta avtal förblir i kraft till dess det sägs upp av en part. Vardera parten kan skriftligen säga upp avtalet genom underrättelse härom minst sex månader före utgången av något kalenderår. I händelse av sådan uppsägning upphör avtalet att gälla i fråga om skatt som tas ut för beskattningsår som börjar den 1 januari det år som följer närmast efter utgången av sexmånadersperioden eller senare.<br />
