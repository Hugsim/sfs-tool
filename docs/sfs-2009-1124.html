Utbyte av upplysningar på begäran<br />
   1. Den behöriga myndigheten i den anmodade parten ska på  begäran av den anmodande parten lämna upplysningar för de  ändamål som anges i artikel 1. Sådana upplysningar ska utbytas  utan avseende på om den anmodade parten har behov av  upplysningarna för sina egna beskattningsändamål eller på om  det handlande som är föremål för utredning skulle ha utgjort  ett brott enligt den anmodade partens lagstiftning om det ägt  rum inom den anmodade partens territorium. Den behöriga  myndigheten i den anmodande parten ska endast begära  upplysningar enligt denna artikel när den inte kan inhämta  upplysningarna genom andra åtgärder, utom i de fall då  vidtagandet av sådana åtgärder skulle medföra  oproportionerligt stora svårigheter.<br />
   2. Om de upplysningar som är tillgängliga för den behöriga  myndigheten i den anmodade parten inte räcker till för att  tillmötesgå en begäran om upplysningar, ska den anmodade  parten -utan hinder av att den anmodade parten kanske inte  har behov av upplysningarna för sina egna beskattningsändamål 
-efter eget gottfinnande vidta alla relevanta åtgärder för  att inhämta och lämna de begärda upplysningarna till den  anmodande parten.<br />
   3. Om den behöriga myndigheten i den anmodande parten särskilt  begär det, ska den behöriga myndigheten i den anmodade parten

form av upptagande av vittnesberättelser och bestyrkta kopior  av handlingar.<br />
   4. Vardera parten ska säkerställa att den har befogenhet att  genom sin behöriga myndighet på begäran, med beaktande av de  villkor som anges i artikel 1, inhämta och lämna:<br />
      a) upplysningar som innehas av banker, andra finansiella  institutioner och annan person, däri inbegripet ombud och  trustförvaltare som agerar i egenskap av representant eller  förvaltare,<br />
      b) 1) upplysningar om de legala och verkliga ägarförhållandena  i bolag, handelsbolag, stiftelser och andra personer, däri  inbegripet i fråga om kollektiva investeringssystem,  upplysningar om aktier, andelar och andra rättigheter,<br />
      2) i fråga om truster, upplysningar om stiftare, förvaltare, 
"protectors" och förmånstagare, och i fråga om stiftelser,  upplysningar om stiftare, medlemmar av styrelsen och  förmånstagare.<p><a name="S97"></a></p>

Detta avtal medför inte skyldighet för en part att inhämta  eller lämna upplysningar om ägarförhållanden i bolag vars  aktier är föremål för allmän omsättning eller publika  kollektiva investeringssystem, såvida inte sådana upplysningar  kan inhämtas utan att det medför oproportionerligt stora  svårigheter.<br />
   5. Varje begäran om upplysningar ska vara skriftlig och  utformad så utförligt som möjligt med uppgift om:<br />
      a) identiteten på den person som är föremål för utredning  eller undersökning,<br />
      b) för vilken tidsperiod upplysningar begärs,<br />
      c) de begärda upplysningarnas beskaffenhet och den form i  vilken den anmodande parten önskar att upplysningarna ska  lämnas,<br />
      d) det beskattningsändamål för vilket upplysningarna  efterfrågas,<br />
      e) skälen för att anta att de begärda upplysningarna kan antas  vara relevanta i den anmodande parten vid tillämpning eller  verkställighet av skattelagstiftningen i fråga om den person  som anges i a) i denna punkt,<br />
      f) skälen för att anta att de begärda upplysningarna finns i  den anmodade parten eller innehas av eller är tillgängliga för  en person inom den anmodade partens territorium,<br />
      g) såvitt det är känt, namn och adress på person som kan antas  inneha eller kontrollera de begärda upplysningarna,<br />
      h) uppgift om att begäran är i överensstämmelse med  lagstiftning och administrativ praxis i den anmodande parten  och att den behöriga myndigheten i den anmodande parten -om  de begärda upplysningarna fanns inom denna parts jurisdiktion 
-skulle kunna inhämta upplysningarna enligt lagstiftning  eller sedvanliga administrativa praxis i den anmodande parten  samt att begäran är i överensstämmelse med detta avtal,<br />
      i) uppgift om att den anmodande parten har vidtagit alla  åtgärder för att inhämta upplysningarna som står till dess  förfogande inom dess eget territorium, utom sådana åtgärder  som skulle medföra oproportionerligt stora svårigheter.<br />
   6. Den behöriga myndigheten i den anmodade parten ska till den  behöriga myndigheten i den anmodande parten bekräfta  mottagandet av begäran och ska bemöda sig om att snarast  möjligt lämna de begärda upplysningarna till den anmodande  parten.<p><a name="S98"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 5"><a name="Artikel 5">Artikel 5</a></h4><p><a name="S99"></a></p>

Utomlands utförda skatteutredningar<br />
   1. Den anmodande parten får med skäligt varsel begära att den  anmodade parten tillåter att företrädare för den behöriga  myndigheten i den anmodande parten närvarar i den anmodade  parten -i den utsträckning som detta är tillåtet enligt dess  interna lagstiftning -för att höra fysiska personer och  granska handlingar efter skriftligt medgivande av de personer  som berörs. Den behöriga myndigheten i den anmodande parten  ska meddela den behöriga myndigheten i den anmodade parten om  tid och plats för det planerade mötet med personerna i fråga.<br />
   2. På begäran av den behöriga myndigheten i den anmodande  parten kan den behöriga myndigheten i den anmodade parten  tillåta att företrädare för den behöriga myndigheten i den  anmodande parten är närvarande vid skatteutredning på den  anmodade partens territorium.<br />
   3. Bifalls en begäran enligt punkt 2 ska den behöriga  myndigheten i den anmodade parten som utför utredningen  snarast möjligt meddela den behöriga myndigheten i den  anmodande parten om tid och plats för utredningen, den  myndighet eller person som bemyndigats att utföra utredningen  samt de förfaranden och villkor som den anmodade parten  fastställt för utförandet av utredningen. Alla beslut  beträffande utförandet av utredningen ska fattas av den  anmodade parten som utför utredningen.<p><a name="S100"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 6"><a name="Artikel 6">Artikel 6</a></h4><p><a name="S101"></a></p>

      a) när begäran inte gjorts i överensstämmelse med detta avtal,<br />
      b) när den anmodande parten inte har vidtagit alla de åtgärder  för att inhämta upplysningarna som står till dess förfogande  inom dess eget territorium, utom i de fall då vidtagandet av  sådana åtgärder skulle medföra oproportionerligt stora  svårigheter, eller<br />
      c) när lämnandet av de begärda upplysningarna skulle strida  mot allmänna hänsyn (ordre public).<br />
   2. Detta avtal ska inte medföra skyldighet för den anmodade  parten att lämna upplysningar som omfattas av tystnadsplikt i  samband med juridisk rådgivning eller handels-, affärs-,  industri-eller yrkeshemlighet eller kommersiell hemlighet  eller i näringsverksamhet nyttjat förfaringssätt, med  förbehåll för att upplysningar inte ska anses utgöra sådan  hemlighet eller sådant förfaringssätt endast på grund av att  de är sådana som anges i artikel 4 punkt 4.<br />
   3. En begäran om upplysningar ska inte avslås på grund av att  den skattefordran som föranleder begäran bestridits.<br />
   4. Den anmodade parten har inte skyldighet att inhämta och  lämna upplysningar som den behöriga myndigheten i den  anmodande parten -om de begärda upplysningarna fanns inom  denna parts jurisdiktion -inte kan inhämta enligt dess  lagstiftning eller sedvanliga administrativa praxis.<br />
   5. Den anmodade parten får avslå en begäran om upplysningar,  om upplysningarna begärs av den anmodande parten för att  tillämpa eller verkställa en bestämmelse i den anmodande  partens skattelagstiftning eller därmed sammanhängande krav  som under samma förhållanden diskriminerar en medborgare i den  anmodade parten i förhållande till en medborgare i den  anmodande parten.<p><a name="S102"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 7"><a name="Artikel 7">Artikel 7</a></h4><p><a name="S103"></a></p>

De behöriga  myndigheterna ska från tid till annan överlägga i fråga om  denna artikel och särskilt den behöriga myndigheten i den  anmodade parten ska i förväg överlägga med den behöriga  myndigheten i den anmodande parten om kostnaderna för att   lämna upplysningar med anledning av en viss begäran förväntas  bli höga.<p><a name="S107"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 9"><a name="Artikel 9">Artikel 9</a></h4><p><a name="S108"></a></p><h4 name="Språk"><a name="Språk">Språk</a></h4><p><a name="S109"></a></p>
