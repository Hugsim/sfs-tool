(i det följande benämnd "skatt i Guernsey"),<br />

   2. Avtalet tillämpas även på skatter av samma eller i huvudsak likartat slag, som efter undertecknandet av avtalet tas ut vid sidan av eller i stället för de för närvarande utgående skatterna. Parternas behöriga myndigheter ska meddela varandra de väsentliga ändringar som gjorts i respektive skattelagstiftning beträffande fysiska personer och som kan påverka tillämpningen av detta avtal.<p><a name="P3S81"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 3"><a name="Artikel 3">Artikel 3</a></h4><p><a name="P3S82"></a></p>

Allmänna definitioner<br />
   1. Om inte sammanhanget föranleder annat, har vid tillämpningen av detta avtal följande uttryck nedan angiven betydelse:<br />
      a) "Guernsey" avser Guernsey, Alderney och Herm, innefattande territorialvattnet i anslutning till dessa öar i överensstämmelse med folkrätten,<br />
      b) "Sverige" avser Konungariket Sverige och innefattar, när uttrycket används i geografisk betydelse, Sveriges territorium, Sveriges territorialvatten och andra havsområden över vilka Sverige, i överensstämmelse med folkrättens regler, utövar suveräna rättigheter eller jurisdiktion,<br />
      c) "behörig myndighet" avser:<br />
      1) i Guernsey: "the Administrator of Income Tax" eller dennes ombud,<br />
      2) i Sverige: finansministern, dennes befullmäktigade ombud eller den myndighet åt vilken uppdras att vara behörig myndighet vid tillämpningen av detta avtal,<br />
      d) "företag" avser bedrivandet av varje form av rörelse,<br />
      e) "internationell trafik" avser transport med skepp eller luftfartyg som används av företag i en part utom då skeppet eller luftfartyget används uteslutande mellan platser i den andra parten.<br />
   2. Då en part tillämpar avtalet vid någon tidpunkt anses, såvida inte sammanhanget föranleder annat, varje uttryck som inte definierats i avtalet ha den betydelse som uttrycket har vid denna tidpunkt enligt den partens lagstiftning i fråga om sådana skatter på vilka avtalet tillämpas och den betydelse som uttrycket har enligt tillämplig skattelagstiftning i denna part äger företräde framför den betydelse som uttrycket har enligt annan lagstiftning i denna part.<p><a name="P3S83"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 4"><a name="Artikel 4">Artikel 4</a></h4><p><a name="P3S84"></a></p>

Hemvist<br />
   1. Vid tillämpningen av detta avtal avser uttrycket "person med hemvist i en part" i fråga om fysisk person, varje fysisk person som enligt lagstiftningen i denna part är skattskyldig där på grund av domicil, bosättning eller annan liknande omständighet. Detta uttryck inbegriper emellertid inte fysisk person som är skattskyldig i denna part endast för inkomst från källa i denna part.<br />
   2. Då på grund av bestämmelserna i punkt 1 fysisk person har hemvist i båda parterna, bestäms hans hemvist på följande sätt:<br />
      a) han anses ha hemvist endast i den part där han har en bostad som stadigvarande står till hans förfogande. Om han har en sådan bostad i båda parterna, anses han ha hemvist endast i den part med vilken hans personliga och ekonomiska förbindelser är starkast (centrum för levnadsintressena),<br />
      b) om det inte kan avgöras i vilken part han har centrum för sina levnadsintressen eller om han inte i någondera parten har en bostad som stadigvarande står till hans förfogande, anses han ha hemvist endast i den part där han stadigvarande vistas,<br />
      c) om han stadigvarande vistas i båda parterna eller inte vistas stadigvarande i någon av dem, ska parternas behöriga myndigheter avgöra frågan genom ömsesidig överenskommelse.<p><a name="P3S85"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 5"><a name="Artikel 5">Artikel 5</a></h4><p><a name="P3S86"></a></p>

   2. I fall då inkomst genom personlig verksamhet, som artist eller sportutövare utövar i denna egenskap, inte tillfaller artisten eller sportutövaren själv utan annan fysisk eller juridisk person, får denna inkomst beskattas i den part där artisten eller sportutövaren utövar verksamheten.<p><a name="P3S92"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 8"><a name="Artikel 8">Artikel 8</a></h4><p><a name="P3S93"></a></p>

Undanröjande av dubbelbeskattning<br />
   1. I Guernsey ska dubbelbeskattning undvikas på följande sätt:<p><a name="P3S99"></a></p>

Med beaktande av bestämmelserna i Guernseys lagstiftning som tillåter att skatt som betalats i ett annat territorium än Guernsey avräknas mot skatt i Guernsey (som inte ska påverka den allmänna princip som anges här),<br />
      1) om person med hemvist i Guernsey förvärvar inkomst som enligt bestämmelserna i detta avtal får beskattas i Sverige, ska Guernsey - med beaktande av bestämmelserna i 3) nedan -
från skatten på inkomsten avräkna ett belopp motsvarande den inkomstskatt som erlagts i Sverige,<br />
      2) avräkningsbeloppet ska emellertid inte överstiga den del av inkomstskatten, beräknad före avräkning, som är hänförlig till sådan inkomst som får beskattas i Sverige,<br />
      3) om person med hemvist i Guernsey förvärvar inkomst, som enligt bestämmelserna i detta avtal beskattas endast i Sverige, får Guernsey beakta denna inkomst vid beräkningen av skatten på denna persons övriga inkomster.<br />
   2. I Sverige ska dubbelbeskattning undvikas på följande sätt:<br />
      a) Om person med hemvist i Sverige förvärvar inkomst som enligt Guernseys lagstiftning och i enlighet med bestämmelserna i detta avtal får beskattas i Guernsey, ska Sverige - med beaktande av bestämmelserna i svensk lagstiftning beträffande avräkning av utländsk skatt (såsom de kan komma att ändras från tid till annan utan att den allmänna princip som anges här ändras) - från den svenska skatten på inkomsten avräkna ett belopp motsvarande den skatt som erlagts på inkomsten i Guernsey.<br />
      b) Om person med hemvist i Sverige förvärvar inkomst, som enligt bestämmelserna i detta avtal beskattas endast i Guernsey, får Sverige vid bestämmandet av  svensk progressiv skatt beakta sådan inkomst som beskattas endast i Guernsey.<p><a name="P3S100"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 11"><a name="Artikel 11">Artikel 11</a></h4><p><a name="P3S101"></a></p>

Förfarandet vid ömsesidig överenskommelse<br />
   1. Om en fysisk person anser att en part eller båda parterna vidtagit åtgärder som för honom medför eller kommer att medföra beskattning som strider mot bestämmelserna i detta avtal, kan han, utan att detta påverkar hans rätt att använda sig av de rättsmedel som finns i dessa parters interna rättsordning, lägga fram saken för den behöriga myndigheten i den part där han har hemvist. Saken ska läggas fram inom tre år från den tidpunkt då personen i fråga fick vetskap om den åtgärd som givit upphov till beskattning som strider mot bestämmelserna i avtalet.<br />
   2. Om den behöriga myndigheten finner invändningen grundad men inte själv kan få till stånd en tillfredsställande lösning, ska myndigheten söka avgöra saken genom ömsesidig överenskommelse med den behöriga myndigheten i den andra parten i syfte att undvika beskattning som strider mot avtalet. Överenskommelse som träffats genomförs utan hinder av tidsgränser i parternas interna lagstiftning.<br />
   3. Parternas behöriga myndigheter ska genom ömsesidig överenskommelse söka avgöra svårigheter eller tvivelsmål som uppkommer i fråga om tolkningen eller tillämpningen av avtalet.<br />
   4. Parternas behöriga myndigheter kan träda i direkt förbindelse med varandra i syfte att träffa överenskommelse i den mening som avses i föregående punkter.<p><a name="P3S102"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 12"><a name="Artikel 12">Artikel 12</a></h4><p><a name="P3S103"></a></p>

såvitt avser svensk skatt, på skatt som tas ut för beskattningsår som börjar den 1 januari det kalenderår som närmast följer efter det kalenderår då avtalet träder i kraft eller senare.<br />
   3. Utan hinder av punkt 2, är detta avtal endast tillämpligt när avtalet mellan Konungariket Sverige och Guernsey om utbyte av upplysningar i skatteärenden undertecknat den 28 oktober 2008 är tillämpligt.<p><a name="P3S106"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 13"><a name="Artikel 13">Artikel 13</a></h4><p><a name="P3S107"></a></p>

Upphörande<br />
   1. Detta avtal förblir i kraft till dess det sägs upp av någon part. Vardera parten kan skriftligen säga upp avtalet genom underrättelse härom minst sex månader före utgången av något kalenderår. I händelse av sådan uppsägning upphör avtalet att gälla i fråga om skatt som tas ut för beskattningsår som börjar den 1 januari det kalenderår som följer närmast efter utgången av sexmånadersperioden eller senare.<br />
   2. Utan hinder av punkt 1, upphör detta avtal att gälla, utan uppsägning, den dag då avtalet mellan Konungariket Sverige och Guernsey om utbyte av upplysningar i skatteärenden undertecknat den 28 oktober 2008 upphör att gälla.<p><a name="P3S108"></a></p>

Till bekräftelse härav har undertecknade, därtill vederbörligen bemyndigade, undertecknat detta avtal.<p><a name="P3S109"></a></p>
