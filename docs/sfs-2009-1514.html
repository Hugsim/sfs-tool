Taking into account developments in State practice with  regard to the jurisdictional immunities of States and their  property,<br />
Affirming that the rules of customary international law  continue to govern matters not regulated by the provisions of  the present Convention,<br />

The term "immunity" in article 10 is to be understood in the  context of the present Convention as a whole. <p><a name="S170"></a></p>

Article 10, paragraph 3, does not prejudge the question of 
"piercing the corporate veil", questions relating to a  situation where a State entity has deliberately  misrepresented its financial position or subsequently reduced  its assets to avoid satisfying a claim, or other related  issues.<p><a name="S171"></a></p><h4 name="With respect to article 11"><a name="With respect to article 11">With respect to article 11</a></h4><p><a name="S172"></a></p>

The reference in article 11, paragraph 2 (d), to the 
"security interests" of the employer State is intended  primarily to address matters of national security and the  security of diplomatic missions and consular posts.<p><a name="S173"></a></p>

Under article 41 of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic  Relations and article 55 of the 1963 Vienna Convention on  Consular Relations, all persons referred to in those articles  have the duty to respect the laws and regulations, including  labour laws, of the host country. At the same time, under  article 38 of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic  Relations and article 71 of the 1963 Vienna Convention on  Consular Relations, the receiving State has a duty to  exercise its jurisdiction in such a manner as not to  interfere unduly with the performance of the functions of the  mission or the consular post.<p><a name="S174"></a></p><h4 name="With respect to articles 13 and 14"><a name="With respect to articles 13 and 14">With respect to articles 13 and 14</a></h4><p><a name="S175"></a></p>

The expression "determination" is used to refer not only to  the ascertainment or verification of the existence of the  rights protected, but also to the evaluation or assessment of  the substance, including content, scope and extent, of such  rights.<p><a name="S176"></a></p><h4 name="With respect to article 17"><a name="With respect to article 17">With respect to article 17</a></h4><p><a name="S177"></a></p>

The expression "commercial transaction" includes investment  matters.<p><a name="S178"></a></p><h4 name="With respect to article 19"><a name="With respect to article 19">With respect to article 19</a></h4><p><a name="S179"></a></p>

The expression "entity" in subparagraph (c) means the State  as an independent legal personality, a constituent unit of a  federal State, a subdivision of a State, an agency or  instrumentality of a State or other entity, which enjoys  independent legal personality.<p><a name="S180"></a></p>

The words "property that has a connection with the entity" in  subparagraph (c) are to be understood as broader than  ownership or possession.<p><a name="S181"></a></p>

Article 19 does not prejudge the question of "piercing the  corporate veil", questions relating to a situation where a  State entity has deliberately misrepresented its financial  position or subsequently reduced its assets to avoid  satisfying a claim, or other related issues.<p><a name="S182"></a></p><h4 name="Förenta nationernas konvention om immunitet för stater och  deras egendom"><a name="Förenta nationernas konvention om immunitet för stater och  deras egendom">Förenta nationernas konvention om immunitet för stater och  deras egendom</a></h4><p><a name="S183"></a></p>

De stater som är parter i denna konvention,<br />
som beaktar att immunitet för stater och deras egendom är  allmänt erkänd som internationell sedvanerätt, <p><a name="S184"></a></p>

som beaktar de folkrättsliga principerna som uttrycks i  Förenta nationernas stadga,<br />
som anser att en internationell konvention om immunitet för  stater och deras egendom skulle stärka rättsstatens principer  och höja rättssäkerheten, särskilt i staternas relationer med  fysiska och juridiska personer, och bidra till kodifiering  och vidareutveckling av folkrätten och till harmonisering av  praxis på detta område,<br />
som beaktar utvecklingen i statspraxis avseende immunitet mot  domsrätt för stater och deras egendom,<br />
som bekräftar att folkrättens sedvanerättsliga regler  fortsätter att gälla i frågor som inte regleras av  bestämmelserna i denna konvention<p><a name="S185"></a></p>

Utan att inverka på tillämpningen av regler i denna  konvention som, oberoende av konventionen, gäller för staters  och deras egendoms immunitet mot domsrätt enligt folkrätten,  ska konventionen inte tilllämpas på någon fråga om immunitet  mot domsrätt för stater och deras egendom som uppkommer i  förbindelse med talan som väcks mot en stat vid en domstol i  en annan stat före konventionens ikraftträdande för de  berörda staterna.<p><a name="S209"></a></p><h4 name="Del II Allmänna principer"><a name="Del II Allmänna principer">Del II Allmänna principer</a></h4><p><a name="S210"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 5"><a name="Artikel 5">Artikel 5</a></h4><p><a name="S211"></a></p><h4 name="Statsimmunitet"><a name="Statsimmunitet">Statsimmunitet</a></h4><p><a name="S212"></a></p>

Närmare bestämmelser för att ge verkan åt statsimmunitet<br />
   1. En stat ska ge verkan åt principen om statsimmunitet i  artikel 5 genom att avhålla sig från att utöva domsrätt vid  sina domstolar i ett förfarande mot en annan stat och ska i  detta syfte se till att dess domstolar på eget initiativ  fastställer att den andra statens immunitet enligt artikel 5  respekteras.<br />
   2. Talan som väckts vid en domstol i en stat ska anses vara  riktad mot en annan stat, om denna andra stat<p><a name="S215"></a></p>
