   5. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person.<p><a name="P2S120"></a></p><h4 name="Article 26"><a name="Article 26">Article 26</a></h4><p><a name="P2S121"></a></p><h4 name="Limitations of benefits"><a name="Limitations of benefits">Limitations of benefits</a></h4><p><a name="P2S122"></a></p>

Då på grund av särskilda förbindelser mellan utbetalaren och den som har rätt till räntan eller mellan dem båda och annan person räntebeloppet, med hänsyn till den fordran för vilken räntan betalas, överstiger det belopp som skulle ha avtalats mellan utbetalaren och den som har rätt till räntan om sådana förbindelser inte förelegat, tillämpas bestämmelserna i denna artikel endast på sistnämnda belopp. I sådant fall beskattas överskjutande belopp enligt lagstiftningen i vardera avtalsslutande staten med iakttagande av övriga bestämmelser i detta avtal.<p><a name="P2S181"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 12"><a name="Artikel 12">Artikel 12</a></h4><p><a name="P2S182"></a></p>

Provided that any credit allowed under subparagraphs (a) and

(b) Where a resident of Sweden derives income which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, shall be taxable only in Mauritius, Sweden may, when determining the graduated rate of Swedish tax, take into account the income which shall be taxable only in Mauritius.<p><a name="P2S215"></a></p>

Undanröjande av dubbelbeskattning<br />
   1. Beträffande Mauritius ska dubbelbeskattning undvikas på följande sätt:<br />
      a) Om en person med hemvist i Mauritius förvärvar inkomst från Sverige, får den skatt på inkomsten som i enlighet med detta avtal tagits ut i Sverige, avräknas mot skatt som personen betalat i Mauritius.<br />
      b) Om ett bolag med hemvist i Sverige betalar utdelning till en person med hemvist i Mauritius som kontrollerar, direkt eller indirekt, minst 5 procent av det utdelande bolagets kapital, ska vid avräkningen beaktas (förutom sådan svensk skatt för vilken avräkning ska ges enligt punkt a) ovan) den svenska skatt som bolaget betalat på den vinst av vilken utdelningen betalas.<p><a name="P2S231"></a></p>

Avräkningsbeloppet enligt punkterna a) och b) ovan ska emellertid inte överstiga den mauritiska skatt som
(beräknad utan sådan avräkning) belöper på den inkomst som härrör från Sverige.<br />
   2. Beträffande Sverige ska dubbelbeskattning undvikas på följande sätt:<br />
      a) Om person med hemvist i Sverige förvärvar inkomst som enligt mauritisk lagstiftning och i enlighet med bestämmelserna i detta avtal får beskattas i Mauritius, ska Sverige - med beaktande av bestämmelserna i svensk lagstiftning beträffande avräkning av utländsk skatt (även i den lydelse de framledes kan få genom att ändras utan att den allmänna princip som anges här ändras) - från den svenska skatten på inkomsten avräkna ett belopp motsvarande den mauritiska skatt som erlagts på inkomsten.<br />
      b) Om en person med hemvist i Sverige erhåller inkomst som i enlighet med detta avtal beskattas endast i Mauritius, får Sverige, vid fastställande av skattesatsen för svensk progressiv skatt beakta den inkomst som ska beskattas endast i Mauritius.<br />

      d) Om en person med hemvist i Sverige innehar förmögenhet, som enligt bestämmelserna i detta avtal får beskattas i Mauritius, ska Sverige från skatten på denna persons förmögenhet avräkna ett belopp motsvarande den förmögenhetsskatt som erlagts i Mauritius. Avräkningsbeloppet ska emellertid inte överstiga den del av den svenska förmögenhetsskatten, beräknad utan sådan avräkning, som belöper på den förmögenhet som får beskattas i Mauritius.<p><a name="P2S232"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 23"><a name="Artikel 23">Artikel 23</a></h4><p><a name="P2S233"></a></p>

Förbud mot diskriminering<br />
   1. Medborgare i en avtalsslutande stat ska inte i den andra avtalsslutande staten bli föremål för beskattning eller därmed sammanhängande krav som är av annat slag eller mer tyngande än den beskattning och därmed sammanhängande krav som medborgare i denna andra stat under samma förhållanden är eller kan bli underkastad. Utan hinder av bestämmelserna i artikel 1 tillämpas denna bestämmelse även på person som inte har hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat eller i båda avtalsslutande staterna.<br />
   2. Beskattningen av fast driftställe, som företag i en avtalsslutande stat har i den andra avtalsslutande staten, ska i denna andra stat inte vara mindre fördelaktig än beskattningen av företag i denna andra stat, som bedriver verksamhet av samma slag. Denna bestämmelse anses inte medföra skyldighet för en avtalsslutande stat att medge personer med hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten sådant personligt avdrag vid beskattningen, sådan skattebefrielse eller skattenedsättning på grund av civilstånd eller försörjningsplikt som medges personer med hemvist i den egna staten.<br />
   3. Utom i de fall då bestämmelserna i artikel 9 punkt 1, artikel 11 punkt 4 eller artikel 12 punkt 4 tillämpas, är ränta, royalty och annan betalning från företag i en avtalsslutande stat till person med hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten, avdragsgilla vid bestämmandet av den beskattningsbara inkomsten för sådant företag på samma villkor som betalning till person med hemvist i den förstnämnda staten.<br />
På samma sätt är skuld som företag i en avtalsslutande stat har till person med hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten avdragsgill vid bestämmande av sådant företags beskattningsbara förmögenhet på samma villkor som skuld till person med hemvist i den förstnämnda staten.<br />
   4. Företag i en avtalsslutande stat, vars kapital helt eller delvis ägs eller kontrolleras, direkt eller indirekt av en eller flera personer med hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten, ska inte i den förstnämnda staten bli föremål för beskattning eller därmed sammanhängande krav som är av annat slag eller mer tyngande än den beskattning och därmed sammanhängande krav som annat liknande företag i den förstnämnda staten är eller kan bli underkastat.<br />
   5. Utan hinder av bestämmelserna i artikel 2 tillämpas bestämmelserna i denna artikel på skatter av varje slag och beskaffenhet.<p><a name="P2S234"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 24"><a name="Artikel 24">Artikel 24</a></h4><p><a name="P2S235"></a></p>

Förfarande vid ömsesidig överenskommelse<br />
   1. Om en person anser att en avtalsslutande stat eller båda avtalsslutande staterna vidtagit åtgärder som för honom medför eller kommer att medföra beskattning som strider mot bestämmelserna i detta avtal, kan han, utan att det påverkar hans rätt att använda sig av de rättsmedel som finns i dessa staters interna rättsordningar, lägga fram saken för den behöriga myndigheten i den avtalsslutande stat där han har hemvist eller, om fråga är om tilllämpning av artikel 23 punkt 1, i den avtalsslutande stat där han är medborgare. Saken ska läggas fram inom tre år från den tidpunkt då personen i fråga fick vetskap om den åtgärd som givit upphov till beskattning som strider mot bestämmelserna i avtalet.<br />
   2. Om den behöriga myndigheten finner invändningen grundad men inte själv kan få till stånd en tillfredsställande lösning, ska myndigheten söka lösa frågan genom ömsesidig överenskommelse med den behöriga myndigheten i den andra avtalsslutande staten i syfte att undvika beskattning som strider mot avtalet.<br />
Överenskommelse som träffats genomförs utan hinder av tidsgränser i de avtalsslutande staternas interna lagstiftning.<br />
   3. De behöriga myndigheterna i de avtalsslutande staterna ska genom ömsesidig överenskommelse söka avgöra svårigheter eller tvivelsmål som uppkommer i fråga om tolkningen eller tillämpningen av avtalet. De kan även överlägga i syfte att undanröja dubbelbeskattning i fall som inte omfattas av detta avtal.<br />
   4. De behöriga myndigheterna i de avtalsslutande staterna kan träda i direkt förbindelse med varandra i syfte att träffa överenskommelse i de fall som angivits i föregående punkter.<p><a name="P2S236"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 25"><a name="Artikel 25">Artikel 25</a></h4><p><a name="P2S237"></a></p>

Utbyte av upplysningar<br />
   1. De behöriga myndigheterna i de avtalsslutande staterna ska utbyta sådana upplysningar som kan antas vara relevanta vid tillämpningen av bestämmelserna i detta avtal eller för administration eller verkställighet av intern lagstiftning i fråga om skatter av varje slag och beskaffenhet som tas ut för de avtalsslutande staternas eller för deras politiska underavdelningar eller lokala myndigheter, om beskattningen enligt denna lagstiftning inte strider mot avtalet. Utbytet av upplysningar begränsas inte av artiklarna 1 och 2.<br />
   2. Upplysningar som en avtalsslutande stat tagit emot enligt punkt 1 ska behandlas som hemliga på samma sätt som upplysningar som erhållits enligt den interna lagstiftningen i denna stat och får yppas endast för personer eller myndigheter
(däri inbegripet domstolar och förvaltningsorgan) som fastställer, uppbär eller driver in de skatter som åsyftas i punkt 1 eller handlägger åtal eller överklagande i fråga om dessa skatter eller som utövar tillsyn över nämnda verksamheter. Dessa personer eller myndigheter får använda upplysningar bara för sådana ändamål. De får yppa upplysningarna vid offentlig rättegång eller i domstolsavgöranden.<br />
   3. Bestämmelserna i punkterna 1 och 2 medför inte skyldighet för en avtalsslutande stat att:<br />
      a) vidta förvaltningsåtgärder som avviker från lagstiftning och administrativ praxis i denna avtalsslutande stat eller i den andra avtalsslutande staten,<br />
      b) lämna upplysningar som inte är tillgängliga enligt lagstiftning eller sedvanlig administrativ praxis i denna avtalsslutande stat eller i den andra avtalsslutande staten,<br />
      c) lämna upplysningar som skulle röja affärshemlighet, industri-, handels- eller yrkeshemlighet eller i näringsverksamhet nyttjat förfaringssätt eller upplysningar, vilkas överlämnande skulle strida mot allmänna hänsyn (ordre public).<br />
   4. Då en avtalsslutande stat begär upplysningar enligt denna artikel ska den andra avtalsslutande staten använda de medel som denna stat förfogar över för att inhämta de begärda upplysningarna, även om denna andra stat inte har behov av upplysningarna för sina egna beskattningsändamål. Förpliktelsen i föregående mening begränsas av bestämmelserna i punkt 3, men detta medför inte en rätt för en avtalsslutande stat att vägra lämna upplysningar uteslutande därför att denna stat inte har något eget intresse av sådana upplysningar.<br />
   5. Bestämmelserna i punkt 3 medför inte rätt för en avtalsslutande stat att vägra att lämna upplysningar uteslutande därför att upplysningarna innehas av en bank, annan finansiell institution, ombud, representant eller förvaltare eller därför att upplysningarna gäller äganderätt i en person.<p><a name="P2S238"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 26"><a name="Artikel 26">Artikel 26</a></h4><p><a name="P2S239"></a></p><h4 name="Begränsning av förmåner"><a name="Begränsning av förmåner">Begränsning av förmåner</a></h4><p><a name="P2S240"></a></p>

Utan hinder av övriga bestämmelser i detta avtal, om<br />
      a) bolag med hemvist i en avtalsslutande stat förvärvar sina inkomster huvudsakligen från andra stater<br />
      1) från aktiviteter sådana som finansiella tjänster eller sjöfart, eller<br />
      2) genom att vara huvudkontor, coordination centre eller liknande enhet som tillhandahåller administrativa eller andra tjänster till en grupp av bolag som bedriver rörelse huvudsakligen i andra stater, och<br />
      b) sådan inkomst beskattas väsentligt lägre enligt lagstiftningen i denna stat än inkomster från liknande verksamhet som bedrivs inom denna stat eller från att vara huvudkontor, coordination centre eller liknande enhet som tillhandahåller administrativa eller andra tjänster till en
<pre>grupp av bolag som bedriver rörelse i denna stat,       ska de

bestämmelser i detta avtal som medger undantag från eller nedsättning av skatt inte tillämpas på inkomst som sådant bolag förvärvar och inte heller på utdelning som betalas av sådant bolag.<p><a name="P2S241"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 27"><a name="Artikel 27">Artikel 27</a></h4><p><a name="P2S242"></a></p><h4 name="Diplomatiska företrädare och konsulära tjänstemän"><a name="Diplomatiska företrädare och konsulära tjänstemän">Diplomatiska företrädare och konsulära tjänstemän</a></h4><p><a name="P2S243"></a></p>

</pre>
Sveriges regering och Mauritius regering för att undvika dubbelbeskattning och förhindra skatteflykt beträffande skatter på inkomst och realisationsvinst som undertecknades den 23 april 1992 (1992 års avtal) ska upphöra genom ikraftträdandet av detta avtal.
