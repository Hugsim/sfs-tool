Ayant à l'esprit le fait que les peuples des Nations Unies  ont, dans la Charte, proclamé à nouveau leur foi dans les  droits fondamentaux de l'homme et dans la dignité et la  valeur de la personne humaine, et qu'ils ont résolu de  favoriser le progrès social et d'instaurer de meilleures  conditions de vie dans une liberté plus grande,<br />

      b) Nul enfant ne soit privé de liberté de façon illégale ou  arbitraire. L'arrestation, la détention ou l'emprisonnement  d'un enfant doit être en conformité avec la loi, n'être  qu'une mesure de dernier ressort, et être d'une durée aussi  brève que possible;<br />
      c) Tout enfant privé de liberté soit traité avec humanité  et avec le respect dû à la dignité de la personne humaine, et  d'une manière tenant compte des besoins des personnes de son 
âge.

   3. Les Etats parties s'abstiennent d'enrôler dans leurs  forces armées toute personne n'ayant pas atteint l'âge de  quinze ans. Lorsqu'ils incorporent des personnes de plus de  quinze ans mais de moins de dix-huit ans, les Etats parties  s'efforcent d'enrôler en priorité les plus âgées.<br />
   4. Conformément à l'obligation qui leur incombe en vertu du  droit humanitaire international de protéger la population  civile en cas de conflit armé, les Etats parties prennent  toutes les mesures possibles dans la pratique pour que les  enfants qui sont touchés par un conflit armé bénéficient  d'une protection et de soins.<p><a name="P1S196"></a></p><h4 name="Article 39"><a name="Article 39">Article 39</a></h4><p><a name="P1S197"></a></p>

   2. A cette fin, et compte tenu des dispositions pertinentes  des instruments internationaux, les Etats parties veillent en  particulier:<br />
      a) A ce qu'aucun enfant ne soit suspecté, accusé ou  convaincu d'infraction à la loi pénale en raison d'actions ou  d'omissions qui n'étaient pas interdites par le droit  national ou international au moment où elles ont été  commises;<br />
      b) A ce que tout enfant suspecté ou accusé d'infraction à  la loi pénale ait au moins le droit aux garanties  suivantes:<br />
      i) Etre présumé innocent jusqu'à ce que sa  culpabilité ait été légalement établie;<p><a name="P1S199"></a></p>

vi) Se faire assister gratuitement d'un interprète s'il ne  comprend ou ne parle pas la langue utilisée;<p><a name="P1S203"></a></p>

vii) Que sa vie privée soit pleinement respectée à tous les  stades de la procédure.<br />
   3. Les Etats parties s'efforcent de promouvoir l'adoption  de lois, de procédures, la mise en place d'autorités et  d'institutions spécialement conçues pour les enfants  suspectés, accusés ou convaincus d'infraction à la loi  pénale, et en particulier:<br />
      a) D'établir un âge minimum au-dessous duquel les enfants  seront présumés n'avoir pas la capacité d'enfreindre la loi  pénale;<br />
      b) De prendre des mesures, chaque fois que cela est  possible et souhaitable, pour traiter ces enfants sans  recourir à la procédure judiciaire, étant cependant entendu  que les droits de l'homme et les garanties légales doivent 
être pleinement respectés.<br />
   4. Toute une gamme de dispositions, relatives notamment aux  soins, à l'orientation et à la supervision, aux conseils, à  la probation, au placement familial, aux programmes  d'éducation générale et professionnelle et aux solutions  autres qu'institutionnelles seront prévues en vue d'assurer  aux enfants un traitement conforme à leur bien-être et  proportionné à leur situation et à l'infraction.<p><a name="P1S204"></a></p><h4 name="Article 41"><a name="Article 41">Article 41</a></h4><p><a name="P1S205"></a></p>

Konventionsstaterna,<br />

som beaktar att behovet att ge barnet särskild omvårdnad  fastslagits i 1924 års Genèvedeklaration om barnets  rättigheter och i deklarationen om barnets rättigheter, som  antogs av generalförsamlingen den 20 november 1959, och  erkänts i den allmänna förklaringen om de mänskliga  rättigheterna, den internationella konventionen om  medborgerliga och politiska rättigheter (särskilt artiklarna 
23 och 24), den internationella konventionen om ekonomiska,  sociala och kulturella rättigheter (särskilt artikel 10) samt  i stadgar och tillämpliga instrument för fackorgan och  internationella organisationer som arbetar med barns  välfärd,

   3. Konventionsstaterna ska avstå från att rekrytera en  person som inte har uppnått 15 års ålder till sina väpnade  styrkor. Då rekrytering sker bland personer som fyllt 15 men  inte 18 år, ska konventionsstaterna sträva efter att i första  hand rekrytera dem som är äldst.<br />
   4. Konventionsstaterna ska i enlighet med sina åtaganden  enligt internationell humanitär rätt om att skydda  civilbefolkningen i väpnade konflikter, vidta alla tänkbara  åtgärder för att säkerställa skydd och omvårdnad av barn som  berörs av en väpnad konflikt.<p><a name="P1S326"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 39"><a name="Artikel 39">Artikel 39</a></h4><p><a name="P1S327"></a></p>

Sådan  rehabilitering och sådan återanpassning ska äga rum i en  miljö som främjar barnets hälsa, självrespekt och  värdighet.<p><a name="P1S328"></a></p>

Artikel 40<br />
   1. Konventionsstaterna erkänner rätten för varje barn som  misstänks eller åtalas för eller befunnits skyldigt att ha  begått brott att behandlas på ett sätt som främjar barnets  känsla av värdighet och värde, som stärker barnets respekt  för andras mänskliga rättigheter och grundläggande friheter  och som tar hänsyn till barnets ålder och det önskvärda i att  främja att barnet återanpassas till och tar på sig en  konstruktiv roll i samhället.<br />
   2. För detta ändamål och med beaktande av tillämpliga  bestämmelser i internationella instrument ska  konventionsstaterna säkerställa följande:<p><a name="P1S329"></a></p>

(a) Inget barn ska misstänkas eller åtalas för eller  befinnas skyldigt att ha begått brott på grund av en handling  eller underlåtenhet som inte var förbjuden enligt nationell  eller internationell rätt vid den tidpunkt då den begicks,<p><a name="P1S330"></a></p>

(iv) att inte tvingas att avge vittnesmål eller erkänna sig  skyldigt; att förhöra eller låta förhöra vittnen som åberopas  mot barnet samt att på lika villkor få vittnen inkallade och  förhörda för barnets räkning,<p><a name="P1S335"></a></p>

(v) att, om barnet anses ha begått brott, få detta beslut  och beslut om åtgärder till följd därav omprövade av en högre  behörig, oberoende och opartisk myndighet eller rättskipande  organ enligt lag,<p><a name="P1S336"></a></p>

(vi) att utan kostnad få hjälp av tolk, om barnet inte kan  förstå eller tala det språk som används,<p><a name="P1S337"></a></p>

   3. Konventionsstaterna ska söka främja införandet av lagar  och förfaranden samt inrättandet av myndigheter och  institutioner som är speciellt anpassade för barn som  misstänks eller åtalas för eller befinns skyldiga till att ha  begått brott och ska särskilt:<p><a name="P1S338"></a></p>

(a) fastställa en lägsta straffbarhetsålder,<p><a name="P1S339"></a></p>

Olika åtgärder som t.ex. vård, ledning och föreskrifter  om tillsyn, rådgivning, övervakning, familjehemsplacering,  utbildnings- och yrkesutbildningsprogram och andra alternativ  till anstaltsvård ska finnas tillgängliga för att säkerställa  att barn behandlas på ett sätt som är lämpligt för deras  välmående och är rimligt både med hänsyn till de-ras  personliga förhållanden och till brottet.<p><a name="P1S340"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 41"><a name="Artikel 41">Artikel 41</a></h4><p><a name="P1S341"></a></p>

Inget i denna konvention ska inverka på bestämmelser som är  mer långtgående vad gäller att förverkliga barnets  rättigheter och som kan finnas i:<p><a name="P1S342"></a></p>

(a) en konventionsstats lagstiftning, eller<p><a name="P1S343"></a></p>

(b) för den staten gällande internationell rätt.<p><a name="P1S344"></a></p><h4 name="Del II"><a name="Del II">Del II</a></h4><p><a name="P1S345"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel 42"><a name="Artikel 42">Artikel 42</a></h4><p><a name="P1S346"></a></p>
