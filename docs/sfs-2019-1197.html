(5) Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State  when the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision  of that State or a resident of that State. Where, however, the  person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of one of  the Contracting States or not, possesses in one of the  Contracting States a permanent establishment for the require-
ments of which the loan on which the interest is paid was  effected, and such interest is borne by such permanent  establishment, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in  the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is  situated.<p><a name="P3S68"></a></p>

(6) Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer  and the recipient or between either of them and some other  person, the amount of interest paid, having regard to the  indebtedness in respect of which it is paid, exceeds the  amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the  recipient in the absence of such relationship, the provisions  of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount.  In such a case, the excess part of the interest shall be  taxable in accordance with the laws of the two Contracting  States due regard being had to the other provisions of this  Convention.<p><a name="P3S69"></a></p><h4 name="Article IX"><a name="Article IX">Article IX</a></h4><p><a name="P3S70"></a></p>

If it exercises such right, the rate of the tax  which it charges may not exceed 5 per cent of the gross amount  of the royalties.

(3) The term "royalties" employed in this Article means pay-
ments of any kind received as consideration for the use of, or  the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or  scientific work, any patent, trade mark, design or model,  plan, secret process or formula, or for the use of, or the  right to use, industrial, commercial or scientific equipment,  or for information concerning industrial, commercial or  scientific experience, but does not include any royalty or  other amount paid in respect of the operation of a mine or  quarry or of any other extraction of natural resources or in  respect of cinematograph in-cluding television films.<p><a name="P3S73"></a></p>

(4) Profits from the alienation of any property or rights  mentioned in paragraph (3) shall be taxable only in the  Contracting State of which the alienator is a resident.<p><a name="P3S74"></a></p>

(5) The provisions of paragraphs (1), (2) and (4) shall not  apply if the recipient of the royalties, being a resident of  one of the Contracting States, has in the Contracting State in  which the royalties arise a permanent establishment with which  the right giving rise to the royalties is effectively connec-
ted. In such a case, Article IV of this Convention shall  apply.<p><a name="P3S75"></a></p>

(6) Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer  and the recipient or between either of them and some other  person, the amount of the royalties paid, having regard to the  use or right for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which  would have been agreed upon by the payer and the recipient in  the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this  Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such  a case, the excess part of the payments shall be taxable in  accordance with the laws of the two Contracting States due  regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.<p><a name="P3S76"></a></p><h4 name="Article X"><a name="Article X">Article X</a></h4><p><a name="P3S77"></a></p>

§ 1. </b></a>    I enlighet med vad som stadgas i grekisk lag angående  kvittning mot grekisk skatt av skatt, som skall betalas i  annat land, skall svensk skatt, som enligt svensk lag och i  överensstämmelse med detta avtal direkt eller genom skatte-
avdrag erlägges för inkomst från inkomstkällor i Sverige,  kvittningsvis avräknas å varje grekisk skatt, som belöper å  samma inkomst.<p><a name="overgangP1S2"></a></p><a class="paragraf" name="overgangP2"><b><p />

Från denna regel skola dock följande undantag gälla:<br />
      a) I sådana fall då inkomsten utgöres av<br />
      1) utdelning från ett bolag med hemvist i Grekland till en  person med hemvist i Sverige och denne icke är ett sådant  bolag, som i enlighet med vad som stadgas i § 3 av artikel VII  är frikallat från svensk skatt, eller<br />

      3) royalty, å vilken § 2 av artikel IX äger tillämpning och  vilken utbetalas till en person med hemvist i Sverige,<br />
skall svensk skatt beräknas på inkomstens bruttobelopp. Från  den i enlighet härmed påförda svenska skatten skall avräknas  den grekiska inkomstskatt, som belöper å samma inkomst.<br />
      b) Vid tillämpningen av den under punkt a) ovan angivna  undantagsbestämmelsen skall, då hel befrielse från eller  nedsättning av den till utdelningen respektive räntan eller  royaltyn hänförliga grekiska inkomstskatten meddelats för en  bestämd tidsperiod, från den å ifrågavarande belopp påförda  svenska skatten avräknas ett belopp motsvarande den grekiska  inkomstskatt som skulle hava varit hänförlig till utdelningen,  räntan eller royaltyn, därest sådan skattebefrielse eller  skattenedsättning ej meddelats.<br />
      c) sådana fall, då ränta uppbäres från inkomstkällor i  Grekland av en person med hemvist i Sverige, skall - oberoende  av bestämmelserna i punkterna a) och b) ovan - med avseende å  de första tio beskattningsår, för vilka detta avtal äger  tillämpning, från den å räntan belöpande svenska skatten av-
räknas ett belopp motsvarande tio procent av räntans belopp.<p><a name="overgangP2S3"></a></p><a class="paragraf" name="overgangP3"><b><p />

§ 2. </b></a>    Svensk skatt, som påföres ett oskift dödsbo, skall  kvittningsvis avräknas i enlighet med bestämmelserna i artikel  XXIII i den mån inkomsten tillkommer en dödsbodelägare med  hemvist i Grekland.<p><a name="overgangP2S2"></a></p><h4 name="Artikel XXV"><a name="Artikel XXV">Artikel XXV</a></h4><p><a name="overgangP2S3"></a></p><a class="paragraf" name="overgangP1"><b><p />

Vad nu sagts skall icke anses medföra förpliktelse för någon  av de avtalsslutande staterna att medgiva personer med hemvist  i den andra avtalsslutande staten personliga avdrag vid  beskattningen, skattebefrielser och skattenedsättningar på  grund av civilstånd eller försörjningsplikt mot familj, som  medgivas personer med hemvist i den förstnämnda staten.<p><a name="overgangP3S3"></a></p><a class="paragraf" name="overgangP4"><b><p />

De  utbytta upplysningarna skola behandlas såsom hemliga och få  icke yppas för andra personer, befattningshavare vid domstolar  inbegripna, än dem, som handlägga taxering och uppbörd av de  skatter, som avses i avtalet, eller avgöra besvär i anslutning  därtill.
